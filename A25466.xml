            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was Bodily in Priſon, Spiritually in Heaven; he is not ſollicitous about himſelf, but his Diſciples, and therefore ſends them to Chriſt: As a dying Father conſigns his Children to a faithful Tutor, and then dyes quietly; he had inſtructed them while he could, and now recommends them to Chriſt. When <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples were gone, Chriſt askt the people, who uſed to flock after <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtry while he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, but now grew cold upon his long Impriſonment; Chriſt asks them what end they propoſed to themſelves; <hi>what went ye out into the wilderneſs to ſee, a reed ſhaken with the wind? q. d.</hi> You could not look upon <hi>John</hi> to be a light, hollow, empty Preacher, to bend with every wind and wave. <hi>But what went ye out for to ſee, a man cloathed in ſoft ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? q. d.</hi> You could not expect any thing ſmooth and delicate; <hi>John</hi> was no Court Preacher, if he had, he would not be ſo long in Priſon, and now in daily danger of his Life. Theſe two Metaphors ſhew what

               <hi>John</hi> was not like: my Text lyes in the queſtion, which is not Negative, but Affirmative; they lookt upon him as a Prophet; an extraordinary perſon ſent from God; yea, ſaith Chriſt, and more than a Prophet; that is, <hi>John</hi> ſpake of Chriſt in another manner than the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; they ſpake of him as a great way off, <hi>John</hi> points to him as<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 1.29.</note> preſent: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſin of the World.</hi> I know ſome give quite another ſenſe of the words, which I will not ſo much as mention, but preſently propoſe what I take to be the ſumm of the Text.</p>

            <p>'Twas but a little while ſince, there was a general flocking after <hi>John Baptist,</hi> as if they would turn the City into a Wilderneſs, and make the Wilderneſs the City.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 5.35.</note> 
               <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light;</hi> but that flaſh is over, and now they are flocking after Chriſt with like affection. Chriſt doth as it were ſay to them, 'Tis a fooliſh and ridiculous lightneſs to run after the beſt Preachers in the World, without propoſing ſome end unto our ſelves beyond the vanity and pomp of the World, ſome fruit that may remain. The bleſſed Apoſtle would have thoſe that had been his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to call themſelves to an account; examine themſelves<note n="(c)" place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5</note>; put ſuch ſearching queſtions to their own Conſciences, whether they be <hi>in</hi> the Faith; whether the Doctrine of Faith hold them, that they do not fwerve from it; and whether the Grace of Faith be <hi>in</hi> them, that they live by it? If not, they can't expect that Chriſt ſhould approve of them.</p>

               <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. <hi>John Baptists</hi> Miniſtry was the beſt in the world, when he began to Preach; and all people that had any care of their Souls went out after him: His Miniſtry differed from the ordinary Miniſtry of the Times: He cryed not up Humane Inventions before Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but with holy vehemency preſs'd the neceſſary Doctrine of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; a Repentance upon which they might expect pardon of ſin<note n="(d)" place="margin">Luke 3.3.</note>; and 'twas <hi>convincing</hi> where 'twas not <hi>converting;</hi> thoſe that loved their <hi>ſins</hi> better than to yield: 'Twas of Divine Authority, yet they loved their <hi>credit</hi> better than to affirm 'twas but of Humane Authority.<note n="(e)" place="margin">Mar. 11.14, 32.</note> In ſhort, his main deſign was to bring or ſend perſons to Chriſt. <hi>I Baptize you with water</hi>

               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Perſons of all ranks, with ſome kind of pains and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal, followed <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> for his convincing Inſtruction<note n="(g)" place="margin">Mat. 3.5.</note>: Some were ſavingly converted, and got that good by his Miniſtry which they made good uſe of many a year after: 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Apollos</hi>
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">Acts 18.25, 26.</note>, that he <hi>knew only the baptiſm of John:</hi> He taught diligently the things of the Lord, and with the help of what he got by <hi>Chriſtian Conference,</hi> he mightily convinced the <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> but beſides few ſuch,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> they followed him, who were themſelves the moſt applauded Preachers among the <hi>Jews;</hi> they, whoſe Dictates were taken for Oracles; they left the chair of <hi>Moſes</hi> to hear this <hi>Elias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who denyed the Reſurrection, and the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul; <hi>John</hi> asks them<note n="(i)" place="margin">Mat. 3.7.8.</note>, <hi>Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come. q. d.</hi> You <hi>Phariſees</hi> are ſo conceited of your own Righteouſneſs, that you think you are in no danger of <hi>Hell;</hi> and you <hi>Sadducees</hi> think there is <hi>none. John</hi> preſſes both to Repentance, that might evidence it ſelf by its fruit to be ſincere.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Perſons that pretend nothing to Religion, but were ſo infamous for groſs wickedneſs, that every one who valued his Reputation, ſhun'd being ſeen in their company.<note n="(k)" place="margin">Mat. 21.31, 32.</note> The <hi>Publicans and the Harlots</hi> got Heaven by believing.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Courtiers, who could not bear plain dealing, yet could expect no other from him. They could not but fear him, though they did not love him. 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf<note n="(m)" place="margin">Mar. 6.20.</note> feared <hi>John, knowing that he was a juſt man, and an holy,</hi> and obſerved him; and when he heard him, <hi>he did many things, and heard him gladly.</hi> As if he would <hi>bribe</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by parting with ſome ſins more quietly, to give him leave to keep others, that he could not part with. And thus you ſee what a Congregation <hi>John</hi> preached to.</p>

               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Thoſe that attend upon the Miniſtry of the Word, they do, or ſhould propoſe unto themſelves ſome End why they do it.

            <p n="1">1. Some propoſe to themſelves no End at all; neither can they ſo much as ſpeak ſenſe to any one that ſhall ask them why they come there: I cannot better expreſs it, than in the words of the Divine Hiſtorian,

            <p n="2">2. Some propoſe to themſelves Ends down-right ſinful; <hi>viz.</hi> Some to catch at expreſſions, for the exerciſe of their frothy Wits over a glaſs of Wine.<note n="(p)" place="margin">Iſa. 28.22.</note> 
               <hi>Be not mockers, leſt your bands be made</hi> too <hi>ſtrong</hi> for you to break. Some to enſnare the Miniſter; <hi>we</hi> need not think it ſtrange, for they dealt ſo with our <hi>Maſter.</hi>
               <note n="(q)" place="margin">Mark 12.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>They ſend unto him certain of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and of the Herodians to catch him in his words;</hi> and they pretend a ſcrupulous Conſcience; they ſay unto him, <hi>Maſter, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man; for thou regardeſt not the perſon of men, but teacheſt the way of God in truth:</hi> Is it lawful to give that as <hi>Tribute</hi> to <hi>Caeſaer,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed for the uſe of the Sanctuary? Chriſt doth as it were anſwer them; If 'twere really a Caſe of Conſcience, they would not ſtick at paying both; the one becauſe they <hi>muſt,</hi> the other becauſe they <hi>ought.</hi> Some get into the greateſt crowd for the advancement of their <hi>diving</hi> trade of picking pockets, they not at all obſerving, how the Devil <hi>tricks</hi> them of their Souls for perverting the ends of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some propoſe Ends frivolous and trifling (though they are ſinful too); <hi>e. g.</hi> ſome to ſee faſhions; ſome to be taken notice of among ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtians, for Worldly, not Spiritual advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. Thoſe that propoſe a good End, muſt call themſelves to a ſtrict and ſevere account, how that end is obtained or loſt. A ſlight account is in ſome reſpect <hi>worſe</hi> than none at all; for by a ſhuffling ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you do but as it were bribe Gods Officer (natural Conſcience) to reſpit you from time to time, till Death ſurprizeth you with a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to give up your account to Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>I'll name four Metaphors which will illuſtrate and prove this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt give ſuch an account as a <hi>Scholar</hi> to his <hi>Teacher,</hi> of what he learns:<note n="(r)" place="margin">Mar. 4.13.</note> 
               <hi>And he ſaid unto them, know ye not this parable, and how then will ye know all parables? q. d.</hi> If you underſtand not thoſe ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that moſt plainly ſhew you how you muſt receive the Word, if ever you get ſaving benefit by it, how will you ever profit by any thing elſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. You muſt give an account as a <hi>Steward</hi> to his <hi>Maſter;</hi>
               <note n="(s)" place="margin">Luk. 16.2.</note> 
               <hi>Give an account of thy Stewardſhip,</hi> &amp;c. But here's the difference between being Stewards to our <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and to an <hi>Earthly</hi> Maſter; Chriſt and his Servants have but one and the ſame intereſt; if we improve whatever he intruſt us with for our real profit, we do thereby give him the Glory he expects, and he will accept of our accounts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt give an account as a <hi>Debtor</hi> to our <hi>Creditor.</hi>
               <note n="(t)" place="margin">Mat. 18.24.</note> 
               <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a certain King which would take account of his Debtors, and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him which ought him ten thouſand talents,</hi> &amp;c. We are ſo far <hi>ſinfully</hi> indebted to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40119:6"/> the Juſtice of God, that unleſs we be diſcharg'd upon our <hi>Suretyes</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt be impriſoned with Devils unto Eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt give an account as a <hi>Malefactor</hi> to a <hi>Judge:</hi>
               <note n="(u)" place="margin">Mat. 12.36.</note> 
               <hi>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak they ſhall give account thereof in the day of Judgment, for by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Unprofitable words cannot ſcape being accounted for. Let's fulfil all theſe Metaphors in calling our ſelves to account; and when we have done that, we have not done all; for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. The ſtrict Account we take of our ſelves muſt be <hi>frequent.</hi> Every Chriſtian is Chriſts Garden, that <hi>drinketh</hi>
               <note n="(w)" place="margin">Heb. 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>in the rain that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oft upon it:</hi> As there muſt be frequent <hi>Showers</hi> on Gods part, ſo there muſt be frequent <hi>Weeding</hi> on our part, or no Bleſſing to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is not a Duty that can be diſpatcht at once; thoſe that do not <hi>often</hi> account, <hi>never</hi> account as they ought. Methinks I may allude unto the dying words of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to <hi>Joaſh</hi>
               <note n="(y)" place="margin">2 King. 13.18, 19.</note>, when he bid the King <hi>ſmite upon the ground,</hi> without preſcribing how oft; but when he ſmote only <hi>thrice,</hi> the <hi>man of God was wroth with him,</hi> and told him, he ſhould have ſmitten oftener. What, do you reflect upon your ſelves <hi>only</hi> upon ſome qualm of Conſcience, or upon ſome rouzing Sermon, or upon ſome ſtartling Providence? Don't you know that your hearts are <hi>incredibly</hi> deceitful; Satan <hi>perpetually</hi> watchful to ſteal away the Word, and he will do it unleſs you<note n="(z)" place="margin">Pſ. 119.11.</note> 
               <hi>hide it in your heart.</hi> Your ordinary Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells you, that you never let your accompts run on to any length, but they are intangled; and that your <hi>frequent ſelf-reflections are always bleſſed with growth of Grace.</hi> But I'll come to ſome Inferences from the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Infer.</hi> 1. It is not the <hi>bare</hi> hearing of the beſt Preachers in the World that will ſave you. Though a Miniſter be never ſo ſucceſsful in the Converſion of Sinners, unleſs <hi>your</hi> Souls be Converted, you had better never have heard him. Let not any ſcoffing Atheiſt ſay, Then I'll never hear any of them more. Sirs, pray believe this one word; that will not make your Damnation more tolerable.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ezek. 20.32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>That which cometh into your mind ſhall not be at all; We will be as the Heathen, as the families of the Country, to ſerve wood and ſtone. As I live ſaith the Lord God, ſurely with a mighty hand, and with a ſtretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you.</hi> God will not ſend his Word to a people, and leave them at their liberty to continue in their infidelity, or to return to it at their pleaſure; if they will live as Heathens, their Condemnation ſhall be far worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Infer.</hi> 2. Many perſons, who lay aſide other Buſineſs, ſpend much time, and take much pains to hear the beſt Preachers, but they either not propoſing, or not purſuing a right end, renders all they do worſe than nothing; and they drop into Hell, while they ſeem to be knocking at Heaven door. We read of <hi>five thouſand Men, beſides Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:7"/> (may we not moderately reckon the Women and Children to double the number?)<note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat. 14.15. &amp;c. and 15.32. &amp;c.</note> theſe poor people when they came from home took Proviſion with them for ſeveral days, drank Water, lay ſeveral nights upon the ground in the open Fields, ſtaid after their Victuals was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But alas! How few of this Ten Thouſand were then ſavingly Converted? We read not of any great numbers of Converts by Chriſts Preaching, for Chriſt but covertly and ſparingly diſcovered himſelf to be the Meſſiah, leaſt he ſhould hinder the main thing he came into the World for, <hi>viz.</hi> to dye for ſinners; for<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> had <hi>they known him, they would not have Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lord of Glory.</hi> Beſides, Chriſt told his Diſciples,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Joh. 14.12.</note> their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be followed with the Converſion of more Souls, than his. <hi>Pauze a little,</hi> and think, how many will tell Chriſt they have heard him Preach in their ſtreets, and they have followed him into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; they have there wanted their ſleep in the night, and gone with a hungry belly in the day, for which Chriſt fed them by Miracle; and yet Chriſt will profeſs unto them, <hi>I never knew you: depart from me ye that work iniquity</hi>
               <note n="(e)" place="margin">Lu. 13.26, 27.</note>. Let me follow theſe Inferences with a word or two of,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reproof.</hi> 1. Of thoſe whoſe other Duties do not hold proportion with their Hearing. Miſtake me not; I had rather never ſpeak word more while I live, than ſpeak a word to gratifie ſcoffers at Religion, who ſcornfully twit thoſe that are better than themſelves with their Hearing ſo many Sermons; but yet I dare not ſooth up thoſe in their Hypocriſie, whoſe Religion lies all in Hearing of Sermons, as if there were no other Duties to be minded; no Family Duties, no Relative Duties, whereas only Hearing will make at beſt but <hi>rickety</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are alſo to be reproved, that only go to See a Sermon. <hi>What went ye out into the Wilderneſs to ſee?</hi> What? To ſee Faſhions? They can give a more exact account of every fantaſtical Dreſs, than of any one ſavoury Truth they heard; whereas 'tis ſaid of Chriſts hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note n="(f)" place="margin">Luk. 4.20.</note>, the Eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were faſtened on him.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond hinderance is <hi>love of Eaſe.</hi> Perſons don't love to meddle with that which they apprehend will be a troubleſome buſineſs. What? To be always upon our watch? To be always examining, why, and to what end, we ſo much as hear a Sermon? This is weariſome and intolerable. For Remedy; Rouze up thy Soul, as thou would'ſt do thy Body in a Lethargy; thou wouldſt then be jogg'd and pull'd, and ſhook; there's more need in thy Soul-Lethargy: 'Tis the voice of him that deſerves to be thy <hi>Beloved</hi> that calls thee; do not give an anſwer directly contrary to Chriſts Spouſe;<note n="(h)" place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third hinderance is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> (As to this) I ſpeak not now of the ſtate of Unbelief, but they do not believe <hi>this</hi> to be ſo needful as 'tis repreſented. The truth is, if we run up ſins into their cauſes, we ſhall find <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> to be the moſt teeming Mother of moſt omiſſions, and of more than omiſſions: <hi>e. g.</hi> Why do you omit ſuch a Duty? I do not believe it to be neceſſary. Why do you not reflect upon the Duties which you do not omit? I do not believe God requires it. For cure,</p>
            <p>Conſider, you have more grounds and Motives for Faith in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than you have for any thing you practiſe. <hi>e. g.</hi> You Pray, (I hope you do, I would not have my ſuppoſition fail me) 'tis more your Duty to reflect <hi>why</hi> you Pray, and <hi>how</hi> you Pray, than 'tis <hi>meerly</hi> to Pray: you may teach a Parrot to ſpeak words of Prayer, but 'tis a ſpecial exerciſe of Grace to Pray aright as to the manner of it. So, you believe 'tis a Duty to attend upon the Word, 'tis more your Duty to propoſe a right End, and to reflect, how that end is purſued, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or loſt, than 'tis barely to hear. Pardon me, if I uſe a nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous Metaphor to ſet forth an odious ſin: Some of you bring your Dogs with you, and they hear the ſound of words, lye ſtill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part when the Sermon is ended. Upon reflection, you'l be aſhamed to do no more.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:8"/>4. A fourth hinderance <hi>is the ſatisfaction that natural Conſcience takes in a little tiny Devotion:</hi> Natural Conſcience requireth a <hi>little,</hi> and but a <hi>little,</hi> a little will ſatisfie it, ſo it be but ſomething: <hi>Doeg</hi>

            <p>Do but review what thy natural Conſcience takes ſatisfaction in, and thou wilt be more diſſatisfyed; bring but thy Conſcience, with thy Duty, to the Rule, and then examine it. To act only like<note n="(k)" place="margin">Gal. 4.30.</note> a Slave, that deſires no more than to turn his Work off hand, to do no more than he needs muſt, this leads to rejection; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Conſcience guided by Scripture, will put you upon doing all as a Child, that the Manner of it may pleaſe your heavenly Father; and this will qualifie you for an heavenly Inheritance: This is the firſt Direction, <hi>remove hinderances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Call your ſelves to an Account, <hi>before, in,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the hearing of the Word, to what End thou cameſt, and how the end is purſued, or dropt.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Before you hear. Solomon</hi> adviſeth thus:<note n="(l)" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God, and be more ready to hear than to offer the ſacrifice of Fools;</hi> be more ready to receive Inſtruction, and to accept of what God ſays, which will be thy Wiſdom, than to offer Sacrifice, and neglect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, like fooliſh Hypocrites. And a greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note n="(m)" place="margin">Luke 14.28, 31.</note> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, cautions us by a double Metaphor at his School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, when we come to be his Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſpiritual Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation will be in this like worldly building, coſt more tha we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and our Spiritual warfare will be in this like the carnal, more coſtly than at firſt we conceive: 'twill coſt us more careful thoughts, more waking nights, more painfull days, more Prayers and Tears, more Self-denyal and Contempt of the World, than inconſiderate perſons will believe. For your <hi>care before you hear,</hi> I ſhall propoſe but three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Renew your <hi>Repentance</hi> of the Sins of your hearing: the more particularly, and expreſly, and heartily you do this, the better you will be able to give account of your attendance upon the Word: This will be like the waſhing or ſcouring of a Veſſel before you fill it, that what you put into it may not be ſpoil'd. According to that of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi>

               <hi>Lay apart,</hi> not only reſtrain and keep in, but put off and throw away <hi>all filthineſs.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſordes.</note> 'Tis a Metaphor borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the filth of the Body, and thence transferr'd to the Soul: Sin is a ſordid thing, and we muſt not only lay aſide all things that defile us, but <hi>all ſuperfluity of naughtineſs:</hi> Some interpret of it thoſe Excrements which we are in pain till we are rid of them: <hi>q. d.</hi> Waſh off all outward filth, and purge out all inward, for without this we can never ſavingly receive the Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Propoſe to your ſelves ſuch an End for your hearing, that you will not be aſhamed of. If God ſhould give you your Liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40119:8"/> what End you will to your ſelves, provided it be ſuch as upon ſerious reflection you will not be aſhamed of. <hi>e. g.</hi> You go to hear a Sermon to ſee a Miſtriſs, is not that an End to be aſhamed of? or you fetch a Walk for your Recreation, and ſit down to reſt you at the end of it to hear a Sermon, and when you have reſted you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, may you not be aſhamed of this? You go to a Sermon for the Language, or Notions of it, though both theſe may be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, your End is ſinfull. But yet I'll cloſe this with this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, viz, <hi>Hold on to hear Sermons, though with an end to be repented of, for while you play with the Bait, you may be caught with the Hook; while you are in the way of Grace, you may be graciouſly ſurprized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Above all, preface your hearing with Prayer: As praying is the <hi>laſt</hi> thing the Miniſter doth before he Preacheth, let praying be the <hi>laſt</hi> thing you do before you go out to hear: <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi>
               <note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.7.</note> Many times our <hi>profiting</hi> is according to our <hi>praying:</hi> But here again, I advice you to hear, though you pray not at all, for by hearing you'l be convinced that 'tis your Duty to pray, you'l be inſtructed, and incouraged in it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>In hearing.</hi> When you are engaged, pray don't gratifie Satan then by a diverſion for Preparation: No, tho it be by Prayer, (any other than Ejaculatory,) that muſt have been before; herein likewiſe take theſe three Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Set your ſelves before God, to hear Chriſt ſpeaking to you from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> The more actually and ſeriouſly you preſentiate Chriſt unto your ſelves, the more you will give up your ſelves to him. I grant, we can't preach as the Apoſtles wrote, by the immediate guidance of the Holy Ghoſt, without all error and miſtake, (Query, whether all their popular Sermons were ſo infallibly guided, it ſeems not,)<note n="(*)" place="margin">Gal. 2.11.</note> yet Chriſt ſpeaks through us as through a crack'd Trumpet: though we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray our own frailties, yet for the main of our Sermons, we dare ſay, <hi>Thas ſaith the Lord,</hi> which is a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking<note n="(q)" place="margin">2 Cor. 13.3</note> in us, this will be matter of thanſgivings by both your Miniſters, and your ſelves, when<note n="(r)" place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.13.</note> you receive <hi>the Word of God, which ye heard of us; not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God;</hi> then 'twill certainly work effectually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Mix your hearing with Ejaculatory Prayers:</hi> Ejaculations to God, and Soliloquies to your ſelves, will help to make and keep the heart tight: Jogg your own hearts, as you do your ſleeping Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; call in your thoughts while they are within call, and as far as 'tis poſſible, think of nothing but what you are about: A Heart thus confin'd, is like to be moſt enlarged both with Grace and Comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be ſure to hold faſt the Seope of what you hear:</hi> Not only thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which more particularly affect you, but that which is the main deſign of the Sermon: I think this the weakeſt Memory may retain; and I think, this will do moſt good when 'tis retained. In ſhort, be
<pb facs="tcp:40119:9"/> be ſure you retain ſomething: Do <hi>thus,</hi> or ſomewhat like it, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>After hearing.</hi> Theſe Queſtions were propoſed by Chriſt, both negatively and affirmatively, ſome months, perhaps ſome years after they had heard <hi>John:</hi> And Chriſt propoſeth that with ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: That you may give a good anſwer, I ſhall commend to you but two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſideration.</hi> Chew the Cud, this is the Metaphor that's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made uſe of.<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">Lev. 11.3.</note> The Beaſts that chewed the cud, were clean for food and ſacrifice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; theſe Creatures gather up their food into a kind of inward bag, and then they ſit down and bring it up to chew it over again, and then convey it into the ſtomach for nouriſhment: So <hi>that</hi> Chriſtian, whoſe ſelf and ſervice is a Sacrifice acceptable to God, gathers up what he thinks the Beſt in a Sermon, and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, chews it over again for his ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in Grace. As your conſidering, thinking Man, is the only <hi>wiſe</hi> man, ſo your conſidering thinking Chriſtian, is the only <hi>thriving</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Add ſomething to your practice,</hi> and continue <hi>[that]</hi> till it give way to ſomething elſe of greater moment. I am far from laying any ſtreſs upon any ſpiritual Prudentials that I can offer, but I would humbly propoſe it to thinking Chriſtians, whether if every Lord's-day, (I do not exclude other days; but) Query, <hi>Whether we may not expect more from Lord's-days Sermons than any other?</hi> The Lord's-day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of <hi>Divine</hi> appointment, and other days of <hi>humane</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency: The buſineſs of the Lord's-day is Devotion, on other days we make a ſcape from worldly buſineſs to a Sermon, and then ruſh into the World again, as if we would redeem that time for the World, that we ſpent with Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: I query therefore, If we do charge our ſelves upon what we hear on the Lord's-day, to practiſe ſomething <hi>more,</hi> or ſomething <hi>more carefully</hi> than before; and to keep to that till that give place to ſomething elſe of greater moment. Did we begg ſomething of God more this week than the laſt: Did we ſingle out ſome ſin for mortification more this week than the laſt: Did we do ſomething enjoyned on the Lord's-day: This would be to us like the Shew-bread to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was made thus: They brought twenty four pecks of Wheat-meal, out of which they ſifted twenty four Pottles of fine flower, of which they made twelve unleavened Cakes, every one was ten hand breadth long, and five broad, and ſeven fingers high; which ſignified the multitude of the Faithfull, preſented unto God in his Church, as upon a pure Table, continually ſerving him;<note n="(t)" place="margin">Lev. 24.8.9</note> as alſo the Spiritual repaſt which the Church of God obtaineth from and before God, who feedeth them with Chriſt the Bread of Life, eſpecially every Sabbath day. Were this, or ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40119:9"/> ſuch courſe taken from week to week, would not this hook into your practice all the great Duties of Religion? And ſo you would give a good account of your hearing; but,</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third Direction is this: Do not only ſatisfie your ſelves, but carry on your enquiry, that it may thrô grace <hi>ſatisfie Chriſt.</hi> My Text is a queſtion propoſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to him muſt we give our anſwer. You may give a plauſible account to Miniſters, but 'pray 'remember you muſt give an account to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> You may by <hi>leading</hi> queſtions miſlead Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as perſons that go to Law do their Lawyers, and they loſe their Cauſe by it; but when by ſtudied Hypocriſie, you miſlead Miniſters to gratifie you with a miſtaken judgment, you loſe your Souls by it. 'Tis Chriſt that asks the queſtion, not to be informed by you, <hi>for he knows what is in man,</hi> better than they themſelves: Chriſt would have you to be plain-hearted and ingenuous, that wherein you ſee cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, he may help you: When the trembling Soul after the hearing of ſuch Miniſters as would undeceive them, is like <hi>Jeremy,</hi> for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being deceived by falſe Prophets;<note n="(u)" place="margin">Jer. 23.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>My heart within me is broken, becauſe of the Prophets, all my bones ſhake: I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, becauſe of the Lord, and becauſe of the words of his Holineſs. q. d.</hi> Fear and trembling takes hold of me, I am aſhamed, I am at my Wits end, the word of God calls for ſo <hi>much</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and I have ſo <hi>little.</hi> Thou enquireſt, Lord, what I hear for? I dare not ſay that my intentions and ends are ſo ſerious as they ſhould be; I am afraid to own any thing that is good: Chriſt in a way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is ready to encourage ſuch a Soul. Canſt thou but ſincerely ſay thou comeſt to meet Chriſt, and to learn of Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch to him, and they may anſwer him with comfort. Under this head, conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt asks thee <hi>here</hi> in this World, that thou mayſt <hi>now</hi> be able to give ſuch an anſwer as thou mayſt ſtand by at the <hi>laſt</hi> day, when there will be neither <hi>Hopes</hi> nor <hi>Time</hi> to rectifie it, if it be inſufficient. 'Tis in this ſomething like our Pleadings in Courts of Judicature; we muſt put in our Plea, and ſtand to it. <hi>Thou knoweſt Lord, there is through Grace ſomething of ſincerity, but for any thing elſe do thou Lord anſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> compaſſionately anſwer for me: Lord, thou uſeſt to anſwer for thine own.</p>
            <p>May we then ſuppoſe Chriſt thus to enquire, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of</hi> any one, who ſincerely comes to wait for me in mine Ordinances? Can we ſuppoſe any one to be ſo daring, as to perk up, and ſay, <hi>I charge all theſe to be a company of proud, conceited Hypocrites,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40119:10"/> they'll needs be wiſer than their Neighbours; they ſpend their time in running up and down to hear Sermons.</hi> Chriſt doth as it were anſwer; Doſt thou make this a Crime? What he did 'twas out of Love to me, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to me: <hi>He hath choſen that good</hi>
               <note n="(w)" place="margin">Luk. 10.42.</note> 
               <hi>part which ſhall not be taken away from him;</hi> and for you, who are ſo ready to accuſe others and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your ſelves for ſlighting, or ill managing all the means offered for your Salvation;<note n="(x)" place="margin">Mat. 22.13.</note> 
               <hi>Bind him hand and foot,</hi> that he may make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; <hi>take him away,</hi> that he may neither make an eſcape, nor have any hopes of Mercy, and <hi>caſt him into outer darkneſs, where ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If you do not give Chriſt an anſwer which he will accept of, 'tis in vain to expect relief from any other. If the Father be offended, Chriſt interpoſeth himſelf, bears the wrath of God, and prevents it from us. Chriſt is the <hi>days-man</hi> between God and us.</p>
            <p>If the Spirit be grieved by our quenching his motions, and ſtriving againſt his ſtriving with us to hear and obey the Lord Jeſus, [provided that riſe not to THE Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,] which the greateſt part of trembling Chriſtians often fear they have committed, though by the way let me tell them, <hi>that their fear they have committed it, yields them ſufficient aſſurance they have not committed it, for this ſin is always attended with ſuch hardneſs of Heart, that they ſin without remorſe.</hi> So that while the Spirit overcomes their reſiſtances, and prevails with them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Chriſt; through Chriſt their ſins againſt the Spirit ſhall be pardoned.</p>
            <p>But<note n="(y)" place="margin">Exod. 23.20, 21.</note> when the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, was promiſed to be ſent before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, to keep them in the way, and to bring them into the place prepared for them; they are expreſly charged <hi>to beware of him, and obey his voice; provoke him not, for he will not pardon your Tranſgreſſions,</hi> but ſeverely puniſh them. Not that ſins againſt Chriſt ſhall never be pardoned, though repented of, but to keep us from adventuring upon ſin, as if it ſhould eaſily be pardoned; whereas the Apoſtle tells us,<note n="(z)" place="margin">Heb. 10.26.</note> 
               <hi>If we ſin wilfully,—there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin: i. e.</hi> Thoſe that reject and renounce Chriſts Sacrifice for ſin, there's no other Sacrifice can atone God for them. I grant, that this Text chiefly concerns the unpardonable ſin: But I pray you conſider, thoſe that do not make it the main buſineſs of their Lives to give Chriſt ſuch an account as he will accept of; what improvement they have made of his Word; if they live and dye in that neglect, they ſhall as certainly periſh as they who commit the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. There are but very few can commit that ſin, but an <hi>incredible</hi> number commit this, without conſidering the danger of it. <hi>Now</hi> Chriſtians is your time to make up ſuch an account, as you muſt ſtand or fall by to Eternity. [Oh that I had but one Minutes ſuch conception of Eternity, as 'tis poſſible to be had in this World! I reckon 'twould influence my whole Life]. Chriſts Sentence at laſt

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> account we give him here; and if his Sentence ben't as you would have it, there will be no altering of it: Your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then will be no ſmall part of your Torment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I can't think that Chriſt will be ſo ſharp and ſevere. This affrights me more than any thing: This is the moſt terrible Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ever I heard: I expected relief from Chriſt at laſt, and that Chriſt ſhould hear me at my firſt Call; though I have neglected to hear him, ſo as to have any practical regard to what he ſaid all my Life. The thoughts of what you ſay would amaze me, did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: But I hope to find it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Do not flatter your ſelves with vain hopes, but let what I have ſpoken fright you <hi>to</hi> your Duty, not <hi>from</hi> it. You may expect as much from Chriſt as you can reaſonably deſire. Would you have Chriſt to be to you like a fooliſh Mother to a cocker'd Child? Let the Child do what he will; do but chide him, or threaten him, he runs to his Mother, and ſhe'll excuſe all, and bear him out in all, though it be to his future undoing of Soul and Body. Chriſtians, never expect it, Chriſt will never do ſo. Chriſt tells us before hand, that none ſhall be more ready than he to help us againſt ſin; provided we will be ruled by him: But we ſhall find none will be more ſevere againſt it, if they be impenitently rebellious.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Zech. 7.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. How abſurdly diſingenuous is it, to be careleſs of our account, and to expect that Chriſt ſhould anſwer for us! Chriſt was more ready to anſwer for his Diſciples, than they could be to ask him; when through Infirmity they were Sleeping, when they ſhould have been Praying: But 'tis abſurd to expect any thing like it, when 'tis not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity but Wilfulneſs, through diſlike of his Service, and hatred of Holineſs: You'd verifie the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſlander of Chriſt, <hi>that he is a friend of Publicans and Sinners;</hi> a friend to their ſins, not to their Souls.

            <p>And now, though I have (in my pitiful manner) anſwered the Caſe, my work is not yet done, till I have anſwered a Complaint upon the Caſe; and 'tis the Complaint of thoſe who have leaſt cauſe; of thoſe who give Chriſt that Anſwer to his Queſtion, which ſatisfies him, but yet can't give an Anſwer will ſatisfie themſelves.

Oh, the Sermons that we have loſt, of which we can give no account at all; and of thoſe that are not utterly loſt, we have made no ſuitable improvement. We are convinced that we ſhould be as impartial <hi>now</hi> in examining, whether we have got ſaving Faith by hearing of the Word: We ſhould be as ſtrict <hi>now,</hi> as if we were upon our Dying Bed. <hi>(We know not whether ever we ſhall have a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; many more likely to live than our ſelves, dye ſuddenly, and why not we?)</hi> Nay, rather <hi>now;</hi> for we have not <hi>now</hi> weariſome Sickneſs to diſable us: We have <hi>now</hi> thoſe helps that we can't have <hi>then;</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

It is only the gracious Soul that is grieved at Heart, that he can't give Chriſt a better account of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting.<note n="(g)" place="margin">Ezr. 9.6, 10. ch. 10.2.</note> 
               <hi>O my God I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God—What ſhall I ſay after this?— There's hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> The Apoſtle expreſly aſſures us, that<note n="(h)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31, 32.</note>

Chear up therefore, poor dropping Soul, and to thy comfort conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not the only thing wherein Chriſt and you Believers be not of the ſame mind: Chriſt puts a better interpretation of his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than he himſelf dares; many a time Chriſt owns that as Grace, which he condemns for Hypocriſie; Chriſt forgives him that which he can never forgive himſelf; Chriſt ſays, Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant, for that which he ever finds fault with.</p>
            <p>But the complaining Soul ſaith, I miſtake him, I ſpeak to the rong perſon. Propoſe comfort to thoſe that are grieved, they can't give Chriſt a ſatisfying account; whereas I am not troubled enough, nor grieved enough; a ſerious reflection upon ſuch returns as mine to Chriſts kindneſs, would certainly break any Heart but mine: But alas, I am next to nothing affected with it.</p>

How do many Souls bring their Complaints to Miniſters, and bring their Bills to Congregations, for brokeneſs of Heart, and a deep ſenſe of Sin, when they are ſo much broken already, that their other Duties are almoſt juſtled out by it.

            <p>And he begins with <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> and puts them both together, either becauſe they were near one another, about two miles

            <p>And in his upbraiding them, 1.

He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them by name and not in general, with other impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for Particulars affect more than Generals.</p>
            <p>Next he proceeds to <hi>Capernaum;</hi> and becauſe it may be this City was under greater guilt than the two former, or any other in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> therefore Chriſt names it by it ſelf, and doth not only name it but notifie it. 1. As being lifted up to Heaven; not in outward Grandeur, Pomp or Power, but by ſignal Favours and Priviledges from Chriſts Preſence, his Preaching, and mighty Works done in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As a City to be caſt down to Hell. <hi>Thou ſhalt be caſt down to Hell:</hi>

            <p n="3">3. He notifies it by the form of his Speech, directed to it in a way of indignation. <hi>And Thou Capernaum:</hi> As if he held up his hand, ſhook his head, and contracted his brow againſt it.

            <p>Now as all theſe three Cities were in <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo they belonged to the Tribes of <hi>Zabulon,</hi> and <hi>Naphtali;</hi> which are foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as ſuch as would firſt fall into the dimneſs and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Affliction in the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Captivities; and as ſuch as ſhould f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which words he ſpeaks to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and are a Prediction of its doom in the day of Judgment. And we might take up ſeveral Notes from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There ſhall be a day of Judgment.</hi> Whether men will believe it or <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>1</label> not, yet it ſhall be. Chriſt here ſaith it, and the Righteouſneſs of God makes it neceſſary; it hath a witneſs in every man's Conſcience: <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, though an Heathen, when <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſed of it. It is one of the Articles of the Creed, and one of the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. call'd <hi>Eternal judgment.</hi> But I ſhall not inſiſt on this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the day of Judgment ſome Sinners ſhall fare worſe than others.</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>2</label> Of thoſe that ſhall be Condemned, ſome will fall under ſorer Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Of thoſe that go into Everlaſting fire, ſome, as in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s Furnace, ſhall be caſt into hotter flames: And thoſe that are caſt into utter darkneſs; yet for ſome is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs. When our Saviour tells us of ſome that are made two times more the Children of Hell than others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. and of ſome that ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes, and others with many ſtripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47, 48. it ſhews there are degrees of puniſhment in the ſtate of Damnation. Some have queſtion'd whether there will be degrees of Glory to the Saints in Heaven; but none but believe there will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Torment in Hell; ſome more, ſome leſs tolerable. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this ſhall I inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the day of Judgment there will be a diſtribution of Sinners puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>3</label> according to the exact Rules of Juſtice.</hi> Why elſe ſhall it be more tolerable for ſome ſinners than others?</p>
            <p>As Grace and Mercy will diſtribute the Rewards to the Saints; ſo Juſtice, Puniſhment to the Wicked. So that nothing will be added a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is due, and nothing abated of what is due; not one ſtripe inflicted, nor one diminiſh't of what Juſtice ſhall determine. <hi>By him actions are weighed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hannah</hi> in her Song, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3. Bad actions as well as good; and the ſinfulneſs of them known to a grain; and the heavier Sin ſhall have the heavier Judgment. Neither this do I inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſaying <hi>is ſufficient ground for our</hi> believing. <hi>But I ſay unto <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>4</label> you, It ſhall be more tolerable,</hi> &amp;c. He adds no more by way of proof; his <hi>ſaying it</hi> is enough. How often do we find in the Goſpel theſe words, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you;</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you;</hi> or <hi>Amen, Amen;</hi> and is himſelf call'd the <hi>Amen.</hi> We owe this defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him, as to believe him upon his naked Word.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>5</label> 
               <hi>In the day of Judgment it will be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>than</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum. And this will lead me to diſcourſe of theſe two Cities lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and from thence to ſpeak of the Caſe propoſed more at large, and generally.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Cities may be conſidered under a threefold diſtinction:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Nominal:</hi> The one is call'd <hi>Sodom;</hi> in the Hebrew <hi>Sedom,</hi> or <hi>Sedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah;</hi> ſometimes we read of the Land of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> and then it comprehends <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> which is often mention'd with it: as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.15, &amp;c. And <hi>Admah,</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> and <hi>Bela</hi> alſo, may be meant by the Land of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Cities of the Plain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.25. And the other City is call'd <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which ſignifies in Hebrew, <hi>A Field of Conſolation,</hi> or a pleaſant Field: As <hi>Sodom</hi> hath its Name from a word that denotes <hi>Secrecy,</hi> or <hi>Coetus Conſultantium,</hi> Gen. 49.6. But I ſhall not Criticize upon Names.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Local: Sodom</hi> was on the Eaſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> which <hi>Lot</hi> choſe at his parting from <hi>Abraham;</hi> and he is ſaid to <hi>journey to the Eaſt,</hi> Gen. 13.11. and was a pleaſant and fruitful Plain, and as the Garden of the Lord, till it was deſtroy'd from Heaven, <hi>v.</hi> 10. But <hi>Capernaum</hi> was on the North, or North-weſt of the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Moral:</hi> Both were ſinful Cities, but their ſins of a diſtinct kind. The ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> were ſins againſt the Law more directly, and againſt the Light of Nature, and of the higheſt ſcandal; but <hi>Capernaum</hi>'s ſins were more againſt the New Light of the Goſpel breaking forth upon them from Chriſt's Miniſtry, and the mighty Works whereby his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was confirmed among them.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt conſidering both theſe Cities, and the ſin of both, gives the deciſion in the Text, <hi>That it will be more tolerable for the Land of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than Capernaum, in the day of Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may not this ſeem ſtrange and amazing? <hi>Sodom</hi> was a City that was wicked to a Prodigy, and to a Proverb. It's ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.13. <hi>That the men of Sodom were ſinners and wicked before the Lord exceedingly.</hi> And impudency in ſin is called a <hi>declaring their ſin like Sodom,</hi> Iſai. 3.9. <hi>And they are to me like Sodom, ſaith God,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſin of the <hi>Jews, Jer.</hi> 23.14. And wicked Rulers are called <hi>Rulers of Sodom,</hi> Iſai. 1.10. Whereupon <hi>Lot</hi> is ſaid <hi>to vex his righteous Soul with their unlawful Deeds,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. And there is a ſin, not fit to be mention'd, call'd by the name of <hi>Sodomy;</hi> ſo denominated from the place. Yet notwithſtanding all this, it will be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> than <hi>Capernaum</hi> in the day of Judgment: <hi>Capernaum</hi> was lifted up to Heaven by many favours and priviledges, which were not vouchſafed to <hi>Sodom;</hi> had means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saviour of the World, and the way of Salvation above what <hi>Sodom</hi> had; had Chriſt himſelf, the Son of God preſent, preaching, and doing many wonderful Works in it, which <hi>Sodom</hi> never had. Many things are recorded in the Evangeliſts about this <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and its Priviledges above moſt Cities. It's ſaid, that Chriſt dwelt here,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40119:19"/> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.13. Here he heal'd the Centurion's ſervant by a word from his mouth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. Here he healed <hi>Peter</hi>'s Wife's Mother, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were ſick, and poſſeſt of Devils, <hi>ibid.</hi> And here he heal'd the Paralytick man let down through the Tiles of the Houſe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here he caſt out the unclean Spirit by a rebuke from his mouth, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.24. Here he wrought the Miracle of the Tribute-money taken out of the mouth of a Fiſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. Here he entred the Synagogue, and taught once and again, that they were aſtoniſh't at his Doctrine. And here he preached that divine and myſterious Sermon about the Bread of life which came down from Heaven, and eating the Fleſh, and drinking the Blood of the Son of Man, <hi>John</hi> 6.59. And this City was ſo famous for Chriſt's Miracles, that when he came to <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> they expected him to do the works there which he had done in <hi>Capernaum, Luke</hi> 4.23. Now when after all this, <hi>Capernaum</hi> did not receive him nor his Doctrine, but murmur'd at both, <hi>John</hi> 6.41. and turned not to God by true repentance: this was the Sin of that City, which will make it more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> in the day of Judgment, than for it.</p>
            <p>But that I might bring my diſcourſe home and cloſer to our ſelves, and to the caſe propoſed, we ſhall conſider theſe two Cities as Types and Examples of two ſorts of Sinners, for ſo it may be ſuppoſed our Saviour intended them. <hi>Sodom,</hi> as a Type of the Heathen, and all that wickedneſs found among them, who have not heard of Chriſt and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him; and <hi>Capernaum</hi> a Type of thoſe Sinners who live under the Goſpel, and have had Chriſt preached to them, and preſent among them by his Word and Ordinances. And ſo I come to the laſt Note, which will fully anſwer to the Caſe propoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the worſt of the Heathen, who never had Chriſt preached to them,</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Note </seg>6</label> 
               <hi>and Salvation offer'd by him, ſhall fare better in the day of Judgment, than thoſe that continue impenitent under the Goſpel.</hi> A tremendous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sodom</hi> is here inſtanc'd in by our Saviour, as being the moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sinners among all the Heathens, worſe than <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> before mention'd, or any Heathen City, and yet ſhall fare better than <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> though none of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s ſins be charged by our Saviour upon it. But they repented not under the means of Grace and Salvation: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they repented not,</hi> ſaith the Text: this was their ſin.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But what is this Impenitency under the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is not all hardneſs of Heart, that is Impenitency: many good Chriſtians may ſtill find ſomething of it; but it is when men har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their own hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8. which are two different things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not any particular act of Sin that may be call'd Impenitency, but a trade and courſe of Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It implies a wilful rejecting the Offers of Grace and Salvation by Chriſt, in thoſe that live under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It implies a ſlighting and contempt of the threatnings denounced againſt Sin, and Sinners.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:40119:20"/>5. It implies a reſolved purpoſe to perſiſt in Sin, though Man knows it to be Sin: when the Sinner's mind is not changed, nor he comes to himſelf, and to grow wiſe after all his folly, as the Greek word for <hi>Repentance</hi> doth import: this is Impenitency.</p>
            <p>This I premiſe to clear my way to the following diſcourſe: As alſo by anſwering the following Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>Capernaum</hi>'s caſe is not ours. <hi>Capernaum</hi> ſaw Chriſt in the Fleſh, which we never did; they heard Doctrine preached from his own mouth, which we never did; they ſaw his Miracles wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, which we never ſaw. Had we had their advantages and priviledges, we would not have done as they did, nor been impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Evaſion is much like that of the Scribes and Phariſees mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.30. <hi>Had we been in the days of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets.</hi> When they at the ſame time were fill'd with that malice againſt Chriſt, which iſſued in the ſhedding of his precious blood. But I anſwer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though we have not Chriſt with us in his fleſhly Preſence, yet we have his Doctrine ſtill with us, and preached to us. And it was not his fleſhly Preſence that brought any Sinners to repentance, but his Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though we ſee not Chriſt's Miracles wrought before our eyes, yet we h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e them recorded by the four Evangeliſts, and by ſuch as were either eye-witneſſes, or wrote by an infallible Spirit, or rather both. And if we believe the Goſpel, we believe what is there record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> and will make their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Heart, as if ſeen with the Eye.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of thoſe many thouſands both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were brought to repentance by the Goſpel in the Primitive times, not one of an hundred or of a thouſand did either ſee Chriſt in the Fleſh, heard him Preach, or ſaw him work any Miracle.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of thoſe many thouſands that did ſee him and his Works, and hear him preach when he was upon Earth, not one of an hundred were brought to repentance thereby, <hi>vid. John</hi> 12.37. And are any ſure in theſe days, had they then lived, they ſhould not have been of that number? Conſidering that men have now the ſame blindneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon their minds and hearts which they had then; and the ſame love to their ſins, and prejudices againſt Holineſs as was then. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Impenitency now will expoſe a man to as ſevere puniſhment, and preſent him as guilty before God at the day of Judgment as it will <hi>Capernaum.</hi> And doth not our Saviour denounce the ſame ſeverities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that received not his Diſciples preaching, as his own. Matth. 10.14, 15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive you,</hi> (having offer'd peace to them;) <hi>depart, and ſhake off the duſt of your feet againſt them. Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for the Land of Sodom and Gomorrah than that City.</hi> And this holds true in every Age, and in the preſent Age; in every City, and in this City; in every Nation, and in our own Nation.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40119:20"/>
            <p>Thus having made my way clear, I now proceed: And ſhew, That Impenitency under the Goſpel will expoſe men to the moſt intolerable Judgment in the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I ſhall prove that it will do ſo.</item>
               <item>2. Why it will do ſo.</item>
               <item>3. Wherein will this greater Intolerableneſs conſiſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That it will do ſo, I need not prove it by any other Argument, than what we have in the Text. <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. And again, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable,</hi> &amp;c. And he adds his <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>Verily</hi> to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for Tire and Zidon in the day of Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that Chriſt hath ſaid this, we are Infidels to the Goſpel. If we think he hath ſaid falſe, we are guilty of Blaſphemy. Is it not he that ſaith, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but my Words ſhall not paſs away,</hi> that ſaith this? Is it not he who is ſtyled the <hi>Amen,</hi> the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful witneſs,</hi> that hath ſaid this? Is it not he who came down from Heaven, out of the boſom of God, and ſpake nothing but what he had ſeen and heard from his Father, that ſaith this? And therefore it may ſeem ſome reflection upon Chriſt's Veracity, and my Auditor's Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and incredulity to bring any other proof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next, Why will it be ſo at the day of Judgment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> Becauſe Impenitency under the Goſpel hath more of ſin in it, than any ſin of the Heathen. And this is the general Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And where there is moſt Sin, there will be the ſevereſt Judgment. I ſuppoſe none of you think, as ſome Philoſophers of old, that all ſins are equal: And inequality of ſin requires in juſtice inequality in puniſhment: That ſaying of Chriſt to <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhews that there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſin: <hi>He that delivered me to thee hath the greater ſin,</hi> John 19.11. And ſo we may conclude there will be degrees of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>And theſe degrees of ſin muſt needs be known to God, who is a God of Knowledge; and being known to him, his Juſtice requires of him Puniſhment in a proportion; though not in this life, yet at the day of the <hi>Revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi> When all men ſhall be put into the Scale, as <hi>Daniel</hi> told <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and Judgment paſt upon them according to what weight they bear. And their Actions alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd and weighed in all their Circumſtances; what Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be found in the actions of ſome, and what Sin in the actions of others?</p>
            <p>So that many ſins that may paſs for no ſins now, may be found ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then; and ſuch as paſs for ſmall ſins, and of little ſcandal before men now, may be found highly ſinful in that day.</p>
            <p>There are many ſins that have more Scandal than Impenitency under the Goſpel, and yet not ſo much guilt: As we uſe to ſay in Divinity, that ſome ſins are <hi>majoris reatus,</hi> but <hi>minoris ſcandali;</hi> ſo it is here. The ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> had more Scandal, but the ſins of <hi>Capernaum</hi> greater Guilt.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40119:21"/>
            <p>Q. <hi>But wherein lyes the ſinfulneſs of Impenitency under the Goſpel above other ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Such will be left without Excuſe above all others. If the Heathen are ſaid to be <hi>without excuſe,</hi> not living and worſhipping God according to the dictates of natural Light; and the notices of God ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the works of Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. If the <hi>Jews</hi> will have their <hi>Mouth ſtopped,</hi> having the written Law of God, and the Knowledge of God's Will therein, and yet tranſgreſſing this Law: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. much more will thoſe who live impenitently under the Goſpel be without excuſe, and have their mouths ſtopped in the day of Judgment. <hi>Had I not come and ſpoken to them, ſaith Chriſt, they had had no ſin; but now they have no cloak for their ſin,</hi> John 15.22. The Goſpel ſtrips ſinners of every Cloak, and ſo expoſeth them more naked to the ſevere Juſtice of God;<note place="margin">John 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>For this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light:</hi> And ſo are without excuſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such cannot plead, as the Heathen may, that they were ignorant of a Saviour, and how to be ſaved by him from their ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither can they plead, that Salvation by him was revealed ſo darkly, that they could not have any diſtinct knowledge of it, as the <hi>Jew</hi> may plead.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Neither can they plead that this Revelation was never confirmed from Heaven, ſo that they might certainly believe it to be from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not the invention of Men. The Confirmation of it is now made evident.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither can they plead, that they knew not that Unbelief and Impenitency were damnable ſins, and would expoſe men to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wrath of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Neither can they plead Ignorance of God's punitive Juſtice: The Sufferings of Chriſt for ſin to ſatisfie offended Juſtice, do clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this to all that know any thing of the Goſpel: And this more fully, than any Judgments God hath inflicted upon ſinners in this world, even <hi>Sodom</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Neither can they plead Ignorance of a future ſtate; of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection of the Body, and Judgment to come, and Heaven and Hell. Though the Heathen had but dark no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the wiſeſt of them about theſe things; yet now <hi>Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality are brought to light by the Goſpel;</hi> and a future ſtate is more clearly revealed than before either to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Neither can they plead ignorance of God's pardoning Mercy, and his readineſs to pardon upon repentance, whereby ſinners may be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ſin, as being without all hope. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee that thou may'ſt be feared,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 130.3. <hi>And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> 
               <hi>And God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes to them;</hi> His pardoning Mercy is now clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, which is the great Motive to Repentance.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40119:21"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But then to be ignorant, will be a Man's advantage, and will furniſh him with an excuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That Ignorance which is invincible, will excuſe, but not ſlothful and affected Ignorance. If a King hath publiſh't and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Law, a Man's Ignorance will not excuſe him from the penalty: And to ſhut out the Light is as ſinful, as to ſin againſt it. When the light ſhineth in darkneſs, it will be no excuſe, if the darkneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Impenitency under the Goſpel is a reſiſting the loudeſt Calls of God to Repentance.</p>
            <p>The Heathen were call'd to Repentance by the Light of natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the Works of Creation and Providence. The <hi>Jews</hi> were call'd by the Law God gave them, and the Prophets God ſent among them; but now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the Goſpel, the Call is louder than before. When the Goſpel was entring the World in <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Miniſtry, it entred thus; <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Matth. 3.2.</p>
            <p>And under Chriſt's own Miniſtry the Call was louder; <hi>The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> Mark 1.15.</p>
            <p>And under the Apoſtle's Miniſtry the Call went into all the World. Acts 17.30. <hi>The times of their ignorance God winked at, now he calls all men every-where to repent.</hi> And ſtill the great Work of the Miniſtry is that which our Saviour ſpeaks of his, and the end of his coming; <hi>Not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> And what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his Miniſtry in <hi>Aſia, Teaching Repentance towards God, and Faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 20.21. this is the great Work of the Miniſtry now. And higher Motives are laid before ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, under the Goſpel, than ever before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the higheſt Contempt of God in it: He call'd by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to repentance before, but now he hath call'd by his own Son. If a King ſends his own Son to command Rebels to lay down their Arms, and accept of terms of Mercy, and they ſtill refuſe, it is greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt than if he had ſent his Servants. As the King in the Parable ſaid, <hi>Surely they will reverence my Son,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 21.37.</note> though they miſuſed and killed his Servants.</p>
            <p>There hath been Contempt of God by ſinners in every Age, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked contemn God?</hi> But this Contempt riſeth to an higher degree under the Goſpel, ſince Chriſt came into the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An higher Contempt of God's Authority.</p>
            <p>To tranſgreſs the Law of God delivered by Angels upon the <hi>Mount</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the People, was a Contempt of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and received a juſt recompence of reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p>How greater Contempt is it to diſobey the Goſpel which was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord himſelf, as the Apoſtle there argues? To refuſe him <hi>that ſpake from Heaven,</hi> is greater Contempt of God's Authority, than to <hi>refuſe him that ſpake from Earth,</hi> Heb. 12.25.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:22"/>
            <p>Rejecting the Goſpel, Chriſt calls it a <hi>deſpiſing both him and his Father,</hi> Luke 10.16. And the Law was delivered in the hand of Chriſt to men, when he came into the world; ſo that now diſobedience to it is an higher Contempt both of the Law and Law-giver, than before. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoke,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they had no ſin,</hi> John 15.22. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Speaker makes the Contempt the greater.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An higher Contempt of God's Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>For the Goodneſs of God is now revealed in the Goſpel more fully and clearly than before: Every impenitent ſinner under the Goſpel puts a Contempt upon the higheſt revelation of God's Goodneſs. And that Goodneſs that ſhould lead him to Repentance, is now rejected and deſpiſed. And nothing doth aggravate Sin more than when commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt ſpecial Love, Grace, Kindneſs and Goodneſs. To turn Grace into Wantonneſs, is great abuſe; but to put it under Contempt is abominable. Man can better bear to have his Power, or Authority, or Wiſdom contemned, than his Goodneſs. Ingratitude is juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted among the worſt of Vices; and the Contempt of Goodneſs is the higheſt act of ingratitude: And the higher the Goodneſs is that is Contemned, the higher ſtill is the Ingratitude, and the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An higher Contempt of God's Threatnings.</p>
            <p>God's Threatnings under the Law were, for the moſt part, of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Evils; but now, under the Goſpel, the Threats riſe higher, and are more dreadful: It is the <hi>damnation of Hell, everlaſting Fire, utter darkneſs, where there is weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth: Everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power,</hi> &amp;c. And great Men cannot well bear to have their Anger ſlighted, and their Threats deſpiſed, or derided.</p>
            <p>But though the Lion roar, and God's Threats are denounced, and his Wrath revealed from Heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſs of Men more than ever before; yet the impenitent Sinner trembles not, but goes on in his ſin, and ſaith he ſhall have Peace; and ſo caſts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the ſevereſt Threatnings of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Impenitency is a diſappointing God in his End. It is a fruſtrating of his great deſign, which is to recover loſt Man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Jeſus Chriſt. And Man is not recovered and brought back to God but by true repentance. And it is his great End in ſending his Goſpel to a People, to bring them to Repentance. And this End of God is now made void when ſinners repent not: Men are ſometimes grieved, and ſometimes angried when they are diſappointed in their End; ſo is God ſaid to be: He complains often of this in the Scriptures, when he is diſappointed in the End of his Corrections; he complains, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vain have I ſmitten your Children, they received no Correction:</hi> And in the End of his ſhewing favour, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.2. <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they have rebelled againſt me.</hi> And complains of his Vineyard diſappointing the End of his care and coſt about it; <hi>When I looked for Grapes, it brought forth wild Grapes,</hi> Iſai. 5.4.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:40119:22"/>
            <p>Our Saviour is ſaid to rejoyce when Sinners were brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; he now enjoy'd the End of his Coming, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. But then, at another time, <hi>he grieved, becauſe of the hardneſs of mens hearts,</hi> Mark 3.5. And there is ſtill joy in Heaven when ſinners repent: And Chriſt's faithful Miniſters rejoyce alſo when ſinners repent; for they now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their End which they com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon, and will give up their account with joy concerning ſuch, as they will do with grief concerning others: Whereupon the Apoſtle, as a <hi>Co-worker with God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> beſeecheth the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that they receive not the grace of God in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. That neither God nor himſelf may be diſappointed in the end of their work, being Co-workers. And Grace is beſtow'd in vain when it brings not Sinners to repentance; and when men accept not of the reconciliation mention'd in the foregoing Chapter, which Grace hath provided for them. It was a ſad complaint of the Prophet, when he ſaith, <hi>I have laboured in vain,</hi> Iſai. 49.4. Much more for an Apoſtle, and a Miniſter of the New Teſtament, thus to complain.</p>
            <p>And much more for Chriſt to complain thus, as ſometimes he did. And moſt of all for God himſelf to complain, as he doth in the caſe of Sinners impenitency. So that Impenitency under the Goſpel muſt needs be very ſinful.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This Impenitency hath much folly in it, as well as ſin. For men to run themſelves into the deſtruction which they might avoid, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the offers of God's mercy and grace in the Goſpel, is not this folly? He is call'd a fool <hi>that hath a price in his hand, and hath not an heart to uſe it,</hi> Prov. 17.16. And the Virgins in the Parable, that loſt their Seaſon of entring in with the Bridegroom, are ſtyled fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. And are not Sinners that continue in their ſin and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency under the Goſpel, thus fooliſh? For they have ſet before them the faireſt price, and the richeſt ſeaſons. The Prodigal in the Parable, when he came home to his Father, is ſaid to <hi>come to himſelf:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> So when a Sinner repents, and comes home to God, he now comes to himſelf, as if his former life was folly and madneſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Impenitency under the Goſpel ſhews greater Wilfulneſs in ſin. As it argues great folly in the Mind, ſo perverſeneſs in the Will. And the more there is of the Will in ſin, the more ſinful it is: As the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay; <hi>Bonitas &amp; malitia moralis ſunt potiſſimùm in voluntate. Paul</hi> could ſay it was not he that ſinn'd, when he did ſin, becauſe his Will was againſt it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20. <hi>The Evil that I would not, that I do.</hi> And this God chiefly looks at in Actions both good and evil. There ſeems to be more wilfulneſs in Impenitency under the Goſpel, than ever before. The more Light and Knowledge men ſin againſt, the more Will there is in ſin. And the fairer offers are made to men of Heaven and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more wilful is the refuſal. And this is the caſe of Sinners under the Goſpel. They do not repent, and they will not repent; they do not hear, and they will not hear; they do not leave their ſin, and they will not leave it.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:23"/>7. Laſtly, Impenitency under the Goſpel is attended with the greateſt reſiſtance of the Spirit: Greater than in former time. There is more of the Spirit goes along with the Goſpel-miniſtration, than with any before it. And there cannot be a diſobedience to the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſting that Spirit that goes along with it: Upon ſome the Spirit prevails, and brings them to repentance; and in others he is reſiſted. And ſome reſiſt to that degree, that they are ſaid to <hi>offer deſpight to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29. And the ſin that is accounted unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is committed againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and it's Thought cannot be committed, but under the Goſpel; whereby Sinners are brought by a ſinful, to a judicial Impenitency, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. So that by this time you may ſee the great ſinfulneſs of Impenitency under the Goſpel, beyond what was, or could be in <hi>Sodom,</hi> whereby mens damnation will be more intolerable.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the laſt Particular, to ſhew wherein the greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerableneſs will conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such will ſuffer greater Torments from their own Conſciences. The worm of Conſcience will gnaw them with greater pain. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of it upon the ſinner will be with greater force and fury. By how much Men have ſinn'd againſt greater Light and Mercy, by ſo much the remembrance of this will be the more afflictive: It was ſome aggravation of <hi>Dives</hi> his Torments in Hell, the remembrance of former good things enjoy'd; Much more will the remembrance of a day of Salvation loſt, and of the refuſal or neglect of Goſpel-grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be afflictive to ſinners in a ſtate of Damnation.</p>
            <p>The Light they have ſinn'd againſt will be Hell-fire in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for ever; and the clearer light, the hotter fire: And the higher they have been lifted up by the opportunities of Grace towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the lower they will fall under the weight of Guilt, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They will ſuffer more than others from the Devil, and his Angels: For that they are the Executioners of God's wrath upon the wicked in this world, is out of queſtion; and ſo ſome think they will be in the world to come, but only as under God's Commiſſion: which they ground upon that Text, <hi>Agree with thine Adverſary quickly, leſt he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee to the Judge, and the Judge to the Tormentours,</hi> &amp;c. by whom they underſtand Evil Spirits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.34.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt himſelf will appear in greateſt ſeverity againſt ſuch: He is ſaid to <hi>be revealed in flames of fire againſt ſuch that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8. By both which expreſſions are meant impenitent Sinners under the Goſpel. His firſt Coming was in a flame of Love to ſave Men; but when Men are impenitent, and reject his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will come next in flames of Wrath to take Vengeance: And in the firſt place againſt theſe; To the <hi>Jew</hi> before the <hi>Gentile,</hi> Rom. 2.9. and to the impenitent Chriſtian before both.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Witneſſes will riſe up againſt theſe more than any other ſinners. The Heathen will come in againſt them, as our Saviour ſpeaks; <hi>The men of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40119:23"/> Niniveh ſhall riſe up againſt this generation and condemn it. The Queen of the South ſhall riſe up and condemn it,</hi> Matth. 12.41. The Heathen, who have gone further by the Light of Nature, than many who have lived under the Light of the Goſpel, will come in as Witneſſes againſt them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> may come in as a witneſs alſo, who under the darker Light of the Law, hath out-ſtripped many that were under a Goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>The good Angels may come in as Witneſſes; who having been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Church-aſſemblies, have heard the Calls there given to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repent.</p>
            <p>The bad Angels may come in and plead againſt them, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refuſed the Calls of the Goſpel to believe and repent; for they never had any.</p>
            <p>Miniſters may come in as Witneſſes, who ſpent their pains and ſtrength upon them to invite and call them to Repentance, but they would not hear.</p>
            <p>Many of their Neighbours and Fellow-Chriſtians may witneſs againſt them, who did believe and repent under the ſame means, whenas theſe did not. All which will contribute to make their Damnation the more intolerable.</p>

I ſhall not diſpute whether any of them may be ſaved or not; yet this I can ſay, that their Damnation will be more tolerable than of many others. Thoſe that ſinned without the Law, ſhall have more favourable Judgment than thoſe that ſinn'd under the Law; and thoſe that detain'd only natural Truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the Heathen,<note place="margin">Rom, 1.18.</note> ſhall fare better than thoſe that ſo detained Truth ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>And among the Heathen, <hi>Diogenes</hi> may fare better than <hi>Dionyſius, Cato</hi> than <hi>Cataline, Veſpaſian</hi> than <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> The laſt Judgment will be exactly righteous.</p>

As the Goſpel is in it ſelf, yet will be an occaſion to many of a Damnation that will be moſt inexcuſable, and moſt intolerable. Chriſt was firſt preached to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was their priviledge; but they rejecting him, it brought ſorer Calamities upon their Nation than ever before; <hi>And wrath came upon them to the utmoſt:</hi> And that Chriſt that is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone to his Church, they firſt ſtumbled at, and then it fell upon them, and did grind them to powder. And how it will fare with them in the day of Judgment, he tells them, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>The words that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you at the laſt day.</hi> And what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be more ſevere than theirs, who have refuſed and rejected
<pb facs="tcp:40119:24"/> words that came immediately from the mouth of the Son of God? Words ſo full of Grace and Mercy, Truth and Faithfulneſs, Wiſdom and Underſtanding; ſo that never any Man ſpake as this Man. As the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> rejoyced and offered Sacrifices of Thankſgiving at the Coming of the Ark to them, but it proved an occaſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of many Thouſands of them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. We may hence take notice, how ineffectual the beſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means are of themſelves to bring a people to repentance. Could any City have greater means for it than <hi>Capernaum?</hi> Here Chriſt wrought Miracles that did amaze them, and preach'd Doctrine that did aſtoniſh them, but not bring them to repentance. The Goſpel doth ſometimes make ſome impreſſions upon the Minds of people, that may ſtill continue impenitent in their ſin.</p>
               <p>Some, when they have heard a Sermon, will applaud it, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Whether it be from a Conforming or Non-conforming Miniſter, yet by neither are brought to repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preached Repentance, and Chriſt came and preached, <hi>Repent;</hi> and yet the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the greateſt part, repented not by the one, or the other.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> God hath a twofold Power, <hi>Poteſtas abſoluta, &amp; ordinata;</hi> A Power that he exerts immediately, or in the uſe of means. God can by his abſolute Power preſerve Man's life without eating or drinking, but he maintains it ordinarily in the uſe of means, which Man is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to uſe; and if he reject them, will be guilty of his own death. God affords Sinners means to bring them to repentance; and if they reject them, God is not obliged to work by his immediate Power. Hereupon God is ſaid to be willing, <hi>that all ſhould be ſaved, and come to repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. by his calling them, and affording means to repentance.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But why doth God make theſe means effectual to ſome, not to others, by giving ſpecial Grace?</hi>

               <p>And can <hi>Sodom</hi> juſtly complain that Chriſt came not to do his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Works in it, and brought not the Light of the Goſpel to it, when ſhe offer'd ſuch Violence to the common dictates of the Light and Law of Nature?</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. See hence what little Reaſon men have to boaſt of their Knowledge, or Goſpel-priviledges, when theſe may turn to their ſorer Condemnation. <hi>He that knows his Maſters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luke 12.47.</p>
               <p>And ſo Chriſt ſpeaks to the Phariſees, who boaſted themſelves to be the <hi>Pechachim,</hi> the ſeeing men, whoſe eyes were opened; <hi>Becauſe you ſay, we ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth,</hi> John 9.41.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Jews</hi> boaſted over the <hi>Gentiles; That they knew God's will, were inſtructed out of the Law, and were inſtructers of the fooliſh, and teachers of babes,</hi> Rom. 2.18, 19, 20. and boaſted themſelves to be the Circumciſion; but yet they not keeping the Law, the Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould judge and condemn them, <hi>v.</hi> 27. We have many among us who boaſt of a little Knowledge they have more than others, and have learn'd to talk and diſpute of Religion, and deſpiſe others as fooliſh, ignorant, blind and babes; when all this may make their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the more intolerable. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> have a Tradition, that the holy Fire of the Altar was hid in an hole of a Rock all the time of the Captivity; and when at their return they lookt for it, it was turned into a Jelly, which they took and laid upon the Altar, and there was kindled into a Fire again by the beams of the Sun. When the Light that is in the Mind kindles a Flame of Love in the Heart, and thence are preſented holy Sacrifices to God; this is Light ſanctified, and ſanctifying the Soul: but when it reſts in the Mind, and is reſiſted in the Heart and Practice of Men, it will, whether Men will or no, ſhine into their Conſciences firſt or laſt, to their greater Terror and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>And therefore let Men take heed of Sin againſt Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Againſt the Light of Nature; the Light of Education; the Light of good Example; eſpecially the Light of the Goſpel: For ſuch Sins make the greateſt noiſe in the Conſcience; do moſt harden Mens hearts; make Men ſelf-condemned, and will moſt expoſe Men at the day of Judgment.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. And ſo I come to the next Uſe: which is, To awaken us of this City, and this Nation, who have had Goſpel-favours and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges above moſt people under Heaven. May we not ſay of <hi>London</hi> as Chriſt of <hi>Capernaum? O</hi> London! <hi>who haſt been lift up to Heaven!</hi> And if any from hence ſhall periſh, and be caſt down to Hell, how great will their fall be! It would be better periſhing out of <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> than out of <hi>London. Tolluntur in altum, ut Caſu gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viore ruant;</hi> as the Poet ſpeaks of Men that fall from high places. What though God hath by a wonderful Hand open'd us a door of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? What though we have ſuch plenty of excellent Preaching? and what though we are ſuch conſtant Hearers of theſe Lectures Morning by Morning? yet if any of us ſtill continue Impenitent, it will but encreaſe our Doom at Dooms-day.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:25"/>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But we hope that that day will never come; and all this Talk of it is but to fright people a little into good manners; A device of Princes to keep People under Government, or of Prieſts to make Markets of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It's true, few live as if they believ'd it. But can any Man ſay that he is ſure it will never come? I think no Man dare ſay that. Therefore it is our beſt wiſdom to prepare for that day which may come, though we ſhould not be ſure it will come. A wiſe Man will provide againſt an Evil that may poſſibly come, though he is not ſure it will come; eſpecially, conſidering the dreadful conſequence of being ſurprized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it's true that this day is delayed; but it is becauſe God waits for Sinners repentance; and would have Men ſaved, and enter in before the door be ſhut. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do any of us not believe it, when the Devils themſelves believe and tremble? When they ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before our time?</hi> It ſhew'd they believed a day of Judgment. But I ſpake of this before.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>But what will preſerve us then from Damnation, ſeeing ſuch a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-day muſt certainly come?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which would have preſerved <hi>Corazin, Bethſaida,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi> will preſerve us, and that is true repentance; which you may know what it is by the deſcription I have given before of its contrary, which is Impenitency. Let us all in good earneſt turn to God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Let us repent of our Pride, and immodeſt Dreſſes in Apparel, and reform; Let our Women take down their high towring Dreſſes, and our Men ſhorten their monſtrous Perukes. Let us repent of our Strife and Contention, and the Perſecutions that have been amongſt us. Let us repent of the great neglect of Family-duties, and our ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much time at Taverns and Coffee-houſes. Let others repent of their Frauds in Commerce and Trading; and others of their Oaths and Blaſphemies; and others of their Extortion and Oppreſſion; others of their baſe temporizing in Religion. Let Children repent of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Parents, and Parents of their neglect of the Inſtruction and Education of their Children; ſo Maſters and Servants of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Duties of their mutual Relation. Let us rerent of our careleſs Hearing, and our unprofitable Hearing; of our looſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath, and unworthy Receiving the Lord's-Supper, and bring forth fruits meet for Repentance. Let <hi>London</hi> remember what befel <hi>Sodom</hi> for not repenting, and take heed of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Sins, which are ſaid to be <hi>Pride,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.49. 2 Pet. 2.6. Jude 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Idleneſs, and Fulneſs of Bread: and Fornication, and going after ſtrange Fleſh: and now have ſuffered the Vengeance of Eternal fire.</hi> That this City may not be called <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Siſter, as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was for being ſo like her in her Sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.48. and her Fruit not like the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> fair without, and within nothing but Aſhes. But I have better hope concerning this City; and that, as God hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſaved it, ſo he will do ſtill; and that its caſe is not as <hi>Sodom</hi>'s, not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40119:25"/> to have in it ten righteous perſons when <hi>Abraham</hi> interceded for the ſparing of it.</p>
               <p>And though this City was once laid in Aſhes, yet not as <hi>Sodom,</hi> which was never built again; and is now a bituminous Lake, call'd <hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> and the Waters of it are deadly, and the Fumes out of it mortal, and the Ground and Trees about it barren; which <hi>Pliny, Solinus, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and other Heathen Writers have taken notice of.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe Laſt.</hi> From all that hath been ſaid, we may laſtly conclude, That Sinners that are impenitent have little reaſon to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe of their preſent impunity. Let them conſider how it will fare with them in the day of Judgment. Chriſt refers to that in the Text. And thoſe who have Eyes to ſee afar off, will look ſo far as that day: So did <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.11. <hi>Wherefore we ſtrive, whether preſent or abſent, to be accepted; for we muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> And hereupon he counted it a ſmall thing to be judged of Men, or at Man's day, looking to the Judgment to come, and that great Day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5, 6. The fal'n Angels are ſaid to be bound in Chains of Darkneſs, reſerved to the Judgment of the great Day; and ſo are impenitent Sinners reſerved to that day; when, notwithſtanding their preſent Impunity, they ſhall then fall under Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more intolerable than that of <hi>Sodom.</hi> As a Malefactor that is kept in the Gaol under Bolts and Fetters till the Aſſize, hath little reaſon to rejoyce in his preſent freedom from the Sentence of the Judge. And this is the caſe of Sinners, <hi>Becauſe Sentence is not ſpeedily executed, their hearts are fully ſet to do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.11. And ſo I make the Concluſion of this Diſcourſe with that which <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the Concluſion of the <hi>whole matter; Fear God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For God will bring every work to Judgment, and every ſecret thing, whether Good or Evil.</hi>

            <p>The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having ſome few Years before planted a Church in <hi>Galatia,</hi> a region in the upper parts of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> there ſoon crept in a ſort of falſe Teachers; who contended, that the <hi>Moſaical Ceremonies,</hi> in particular, that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was ſtill to be obſerved, even by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not juſtified before God by <hi>Faith,</hi> but by the <hi>Works of the Law.</hi> Which two <hi>Errors,</hi> when he had fully confuted in the former part of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> he Applies in this <hi>Chapter</hi> and in the <hi>Next.</hi> 1. By way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to <hi>ſtand faſt</hi> in this their <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> ver. 1. which he backs with divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 2. By way of <hi>Direction,</hi> to uſe the ſame aright, not for an <hi>occaſion to the Fleſh,</hi> ver. 13. the <hi>Works</hi> whereof he afterwards reckons up at large; but rather, that they ſhould by <hi>Love ſerve</hi> one another, and abound in all Holineſs and Goodneſs, which he inlargeth upon in the reſt of this <hi>Chapter</hi> and in the <hi>Next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Text</hi> in hand lies within the Verge of this latter <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe;</hi> where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſing their own Weapon, <hi>the Law,</hi> whereof they crack'd ſo much, againſt themſelves; he roundly tells them, that the <hi>whole Law,</hi> to wit, the <hi>ſecond Table,</hi> which alſo hath an inviolable connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>firſt,</hi> is fulfilled in <hi>loving their Neighbour as themſelves;</hi> and ſo, though they were free from the Law of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> yet not from the Law of <hi>Love;</hi> and though the <hi>Moral</hi> Law had now no power to

            <p>In which <hi>Words</hi> you may ſee, 1.

Here is <hi>the Danger forewarn'd,</hi> in Caſe they proceeded therein; <hi>take heed that ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed one of another;</hi> that is, you will certainly deſtroy one another.

            <p>Now if we conſider theſe words only <hi>in Hypotheſi,</hi> or in <hi>Relation</hi> to theſe Perſons in the <hi>Text,</hi> they teach us, 1. That there were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in the Church of <hi>Galatia:</hi> So that <hi>

            <p n="2">2. That many People were Violent in them: For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would ſcarce have expreſs'd himſelf in ſuch terms of <hi>biting</hi> and <hi>devouring,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there had been ſome outragious Carriage among them toward one another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That theſe Contentions were very dangerous to them all: They threatned no leſs than the overthrow of both the contending Parties, the conſumption of them all.</p>
            <p>But conſidering the words of the <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Theſi,</hi> or <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> which we may ſafely do, ſeeing the ſame Cauſes do ſtill produce, or at leaſt diſpoſe unto the ſame Effects, we may collect this Concluſion.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Matter</hi> of Contentions; and they are either of a <hi>Civil,</hi> or of a <hi>Spiritual Nature.</hi> 1. Of a <hi>Civil Nature,</hi> which concern Men in their Lives, Liberties, Names, or Eſtates: And theſe are either <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:27"/> or <hi>Publick.</hi> 1. <hi>Private Contentions,</hi> which are about <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> and theſe are troubleſome to thoſe which are in the right, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to thoſe that are in the wrong, and oftentimes ruinous unto both; and therefore are by all good means to be prevented, or elſe by all fair and juſt means to be managed; and all fit opportunities are to be watched, not ſo much to obtain a full <hi>Victory,</hi> as a quiet <hi>Concluſion;</hi> leſt the Remedy prove, as it doth frequently, worſe than the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. 2. <hi>Publick Contentions,</hi> which are uſually about the Succeſſion, Power or Prerogative of <hi>Princes,</hi> and the Liberties or Properties of <hi>Subjects.</hi> And here, ſeeing Right and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

Now as it is very culpable to be <hi>Circumſtantial</hi> in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> ſo it is very ridiculous to be <hi>Fundamental</hi> in <hi>Circumſtantials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt Diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Manner</hi> of theſe Contentions. They are either 1. <hi>Charitable,</hi> when there is Love in the <hi>Heart,</hi> when there is Kindneſs in the <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>Pen,</hi> when there is a civil and ſweet Behaviour in the <hi>Carriage</hi> of the Parties that differ; and theſe may be called rather <hi>Diſſentions</hi> than <hi>Contentions;</hi> rather differing from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Conceptions,</hi> than contrary to one anothers <hi>Perſons.</hi> Or elſe they are 2. <hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>What Deſtruction</hi> thoſe do prepare for, which is the <hi>Predicate of the Propoſition:</hi> And the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> they threaten, is, 1. <hi>Mutual</hi> or <hi>Total:</hi> All that the one oppoſite Party aims at, is to diſgrace, to run down and to ruine the other; but take heed that ye be not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Amplifying</hi> and <hi>Confirming</hi> of this Point ſhall be done under theſe following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there ever were, are, and will be Differences amongſt God's own People in the matters of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That theſe Differences may, and ſhould be managed with Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That theſe Contentions are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable, when men bite and devour one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That ſuch Contentions do prepare for Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1. <hi>There ever were, are, and will be Differences among God's own People in the matters of Religion:</hi> Even amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had ſuch punctual Rules preſcrib'd before them, yet the School of <hi>Hillel</hi> went one way, and the School of <hi>Shammai</hi> went another, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ſometimes were ſprinkled with the <hi>Blood</hi> one of another. And no ſooner was the Goſpel planted, but the Profeſſors of it fell at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance about matters of Religion: Plain in the Controverſies about <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> for the quieting whereof that famous <hi>Council</hi> met at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> Act. 15. The like Differences aroſe in the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Dayes,</hi> the ſtrong Chriſtians deſpiſing the weak, and the weak cenſuring the ſtrong, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. The like Diſſention in the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> about eating <hi>Meats offer'd to Idols,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. and about the exerciſe of <hi>ſpiritual Gifts,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. In the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> you may perceive by this <hi>Text,</hi> to what height their Differences did riſe, that they were in danger to <hi>devour one another.</hi> At <hi>Philipi, Coloſſe</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> matters were much at the ſame paſs: Scarce any ſingle Church in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was clear of Difference in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And this whilſt the Blood of <hi>Our Saviour</hi> was warm, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were yet alive. Shortly after, what dreadful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions were kindled in the Church by <hi>Novatus,</hi> then by <hi>Donatus;</hi> to ſay nothing of other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who not holding the Head, cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be reckon'd in the Body Myſtical of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Church. The Story is ſadly remarkable of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> two Biſhops that contended ſo bitterly with one another, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his fury wiſht that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> might never dye a Biſhop, and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in his Paſſion wiſht that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might never go home-alive; and the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> tells us, that it fell out to them both accordingly. So that no conſidering man will admire, or be offended at a Diſeaſe, which hath been incident to the true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all ages paſt.</p>
            <p>Let not the preſent <hi>Church of Rome</hi> too much boaſt of her <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> for the Caſe hath been no better there: For, as there hath been more <hi>Schiſms</hi> among them, than in any other Church whatſoever, ſo there
<pb facs="tcp:40119:28"/> have been Collected out of the very Writings of their <hi>Eminent Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,</hi> ſome <hi>Hundreds</hi> of Differences among themſelves in <hi>Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and they are Strangers in the World that are ignorant of the Quarrels between the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and the <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> and many can ſtill remember the fewds between the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts,</hi> all of them within that Communion.</p>
            <p>And it is not only among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that theſe Differences in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters are to be found; but the like <hi>Diſſention</hi> is to be met with among <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels:</hi> The <hi>Perſian Kingdom</hi> and divers <hi>Others</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Haly,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> and his <hi>Dominions</hi> following <hi>Oſman,</hi> the two great <hi>Sect-maſters</hi> in that ſorry Religion; inſomuch as the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Turks</hi> do execrate the other in their daily Prayers, ſaying, <hi>Curſed be Ebubeker, Omar and Oſman, and God be favourable to Haly, and be well pleaſed with him.</hi> Yea, it is no better among the very <hi>Heathens,</hi> even the moſt learned of them, to wit, the <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> of whom <hi>One</hi> of their <hi>Own</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tunc inter Philoſophos conveniet, quando inter Horologia:</hi> Well therefore doth <hi>Athanaſius</hi> anſwer them, when they objected Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinions to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, that even they did ſome of them worſhip <hi>one God,</hi> and ſome of them <hi>another,</hi> and could neither agree about the <hi>Object,</hi> nor the <hi>Manner</hi> of their Devotions.</p>
            <p>By all which it is evident, that as there have been different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices among all ſorts of Religions in the World, ſo the <hi>Church of God</hi> hath been ſubject to the ſame Malady.</p>
            <p>And as it <hi>was</hi> from the beginning, ſo it is <hi>now,</hi> and ſo <hi>will it be,</hi> 'till the World have an end, until the Church of God be preſented <hi>to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing:</hi> And the <hi>Cauſes</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are evident.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our general <hi>Imperfection</hi> in this Life: As the beſt men are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in their <hi>Holineſs,</hi> ſo are they in their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> there will be Defects in our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> as well as in our <hi>Will:</hi> Some are <hi>Babes</hi> in Knowledge, others are <hi>ſtrong Men;</hi> ſome have <hi>need of Milk,</hi> being <hi>unskilful in the Word of righteouſneſs;</hi> others are of <hi>fuller Age,</hi> and have their <hi>ſenſes exercis'd to diſcern both good and evil,</hi> Heb. 5.12, 13, 14. Fooliſh men are ready to burthen the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in <hi>Vulgar Tongues</hi> with the Differences that are found in Religion; but therein they blaſpheme the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for the Word of God is a clear <hi>Light;</hi> the Cauſe of Miſtakes is the weakneſs and blindneſs of our <hi>Eye-ſight,</hi> whereby we cannot all with equal clearneſs ſee into the meaning of it, by reaſon of this our Imperfection: So that it is ſcarce poſſible to prevent all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinions in Religion, unleſs every pious Man had a Promiſe of <hi>Infallibility</hi> annexed to his <hi>Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Mens <hi>Education</hi> contributes much hereunto: It is manifeſt how ſtrong an Influence this hath upon all Peoples Underſtandings: The Principles which <hi>then</hi> they imbibe, be they right or wrong, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally live and dye with: Few will be at the pains to examine them, and few have a mind to alter them. So that it is much to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40119:28"/> that if it had been the fate of many of our profeſſed Chriſtians; to have been born and bred under the <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> they had both quietly and reſolutely proceeded in their Religion. And proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be bred under Parents, Maſters, or Tutors of a different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Practice in the true Religion, muſt needs greatly byaſs ſuch Perſons towards the ſame; and every one not having the very ſame <hi>Education,</hi> there follows a kind of neceſſity of ſome difference in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mens <hi>Capacities</hi> are different: Some have a greater <hi>ſagacity</hi> to penetrate into things than others; ſome have a clearer <hi>Judgment</hi> to weigh and determine of things than others; ſome have more ſolid <hi>Learning</hi> by far than others, and theſe doubtleſs will attain to an higher Form and Claſs than others can. Others have neither ſuch natural <hi>Abilities,</hi> nor <hi>Time</hi> to read and think of matters, ſo as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and advance their minds to the pitch of others. And there are not a few, who as they are <hi>duller</hi> in <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> ſo they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>hotter</hi> in <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Reſolution.</hi> And it is ſcarce poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce theſe Perſons, that are ſo unequal in their <hi>Capacity,</hi> to an Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Opinion: And then out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth will be apt to ſpeak, and ſo there will follow ſome <hi>Difference</hi> in the matters of Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mens natural <hi>Tempers</hi> are different; ſome more airy and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> ſome more ſtiff and <hi>Melancholy;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Complexions</hi> do ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſenſibly incline People to thoſe Sentiments that are moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper to ſuch Temperaments; which being diverſe, yea, almoſt contrary, muſt of neceſſity when they are applied to matters of Religion, breed variety of Apprehenſions. And the ſame <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> which inſpired the ſacred Pen-men of the Scriptures, and yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in adapts himſelf, as is manifeſt, to their Natural Genius, cannot be expected in his Ordinary <hi>Illuminations</hi> to thwart and ſtifle the natural temper of all Mankind; neither are thoſe Notions which do grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens Natural Conſtitution, eaſily any other way altered. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mens <hi>Intereſts</hi> are different; the beſt of Men have ſomething of the <hi>Old Adam</hi> in them: And though the ſincere Chriſtian muſt and will ſtrive againſt any ſuch Temptation, yet according to the ſtrength of unmortified Corruption Men will be prone to be for this Opinion, Practice or Party, and againſt that Opinion, Practice or Party that falls in or out with their Worldly Intereſt. Not that any good Man doth wittingly calculate his Profeſſion for his baſer ends, but yet they may ſecretly byaſs him, eſpecially in more minute and dubious matters belonging to Religion. It is a great Queſtion, what Way or Party many Men would chuſe, if their preſent Profeſſion were quite ſtript of all carnal and worldly Advantages and Conſiderations, and that they were left to ſquare out their Religion only with the Bible.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe and many other Cauſes it ſadly follows, (for the conſequence is a matter to be bewailed) there will be <hi>Differences</hi> among the People of God in Points of <hi>Religion;</hi> eſpecially in <hi>minuter matters,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:29"/> which are but darkly deſcrib'd, and more darkly apprehended by the Sons of Men. In ſhort, that there is no more hope of perfect.

The Spirit of God, which is promiſed unto his Church, and which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Believer ſhall have for asking, will <hi>guide</hi> all ſuch <hi>into all</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſaving <hi>Truth;</hi> and all other <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> ſave in the <hi>Truth,</hi> is but <hi>Conſpiracy:</hi> 
               <q>Accurſed is that Charity, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Shipwrack of Faith or Truth, to which all things muſt give place, both Charity, yea on Apoſtle, yea an Angel from Heaven.</q> 
               <hi>If the one muſt be diſpenſed withal,</hi> it is <hi>Peace and not Truth. Better to have Truth without publick Peace, than Peace without ſaving Truth:</hi> So Dr. <hi>Gauden.</hi> We muſt not ſail for the <hi>Commodity</hi> of Peace beyond the <hi>Line of Truth;</hi> we muſt break the Peace in Truths quarrel, ſo <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learned man.</hi> But this is to be underſtood of <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Truths, in which Caſe, that Man little conſults the Will and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, who will expoſe the Truth to obtain (as ſaith <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi>) the <hi>repute of an eaſie mildneſs: Specioſum quidem nomen eſt pacis, &amp; pulchra opinio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitatis, ſed quis dubitat eam ſolam Eccleſiae pacem eſſe, qua Chriſti eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary.</hi> But when as, after all ſuch endeavours have been uſed, as are within the reach of a Mans Parts and Calling, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ill Differences do remain in ſmaller matters, theſe ought to be managed with all <hi>Charity;</hi> that is, with true <hi>Love,</hi> a Love of <hi>Honour</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe that are above us; a Love of <hi>Condeſcention</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to thoſe that are below us; and a Love of hearty <hi>Good-will</hi> and Kindneſs to thoſe that are equal to us; for <hi>Aquinas</hi> well ſaith, that <hi>that Concord which is the Effect of Charity, is the union of Affections not of Opinions:</hi> There may be the ſame Love in the Heart, where there are not the ſame Notions in the Head; and this will keep the ſtrong Chriſtian from deſpiſing the weak, and this will keep the weak Chriſtian from cenſuring and judging the ſtrong. They may be of the <hi>ſame Heart,</hi> who are not every way of the <hi>ſame Mind;</hi> or elſe there could ſcarce be real Affection between any two Perſons in the World: <hi>Pax non eſt conſenſio ingeniorum, ſed conjunctio animorum; ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in omnibus tecum, nunc quidem non poſſum, ſed amare debeo;</hi> as <hi>Naera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> well ſaid. This is that more excellent way, which the Apoſtle doth ſo divinely deſcribe and advance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. throughout a whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>But yet this Method is <hi>Hard,</hi> and very <hi>rare,</hi> and that chiefly by reaſon of our <hi>Pride:</hi> Moſt men thinking too well of themſelves, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40119:29"/> conſequently of their Opinion and Practice; and thereupon vilifying all others that differ from them. Every man would be a Law-giver, a God to another, would preſcribe to them and quarrel with them for their Diſſent; inſomuch as the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> affirms, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. that <hi>Only by Pride comes contention.</hi> If we had but that <hi>lowlineſs of mind,</hi> whereby to <hi>eſteem others better than our ſelves,</hi> then nothing would be done <hi>through ſtrife or vain-glory,</hi> which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth earneſtly require, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.3. But we are as apt to be fond of our own Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as of our own Children; and as rarely to value others, as if we were the only People, and <hi>Wiſdom muſt dye with us,</hi> and all others muſt ſtrike ſail unto us: And from this root ſprings <hi>Paſſion</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of ſpirit; and then <hi>perit Judicium, cùm res tranſit in Affectum;</hi> when mens Paſſions are once kindled, then Wrath and Revenge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Controverſie, and one Chriſtian is ready to <hi>bite and devour another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly it <hi>ſhould not</hi> be thus: Religious Differences ſhould be managed religiouſly; that is, piouſly and charitably: This <hi>may be,</hi> 'tis poſſible, for it is preſcrib'd and preſs'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge one another any more — And why doſt thou judge thy brother, or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy brother?</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Let us therefore follow after the things that make for peace.</hi> And this <hi>ſhould be;</hi> for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a Grace of an univerſal extent, we owe it to all, to the weak, to the ignorant, to the peeviſh, to the proud, to the good and to the bad, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another.</hi> And it is of that neceſſary <hi>Connexion</hi> with other ſaving Graces, that we can neither have <hi>Faith</hi> nor <hi>Hope,</hi> unleſs we have <hi>Charity;</hi> yea, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of theſe is Charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.13. And herein the <hi>true Church of Chriſt</hi> hath ever excelled: The <hi>Fathers</hi> of old in their dealing wit the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> would account them their Brethren, when they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them for a Reciprocation. And it is a Golden ſaying of <hi>Bernard; Adhaerebo vobis, etiamſi nolitis, adhaerebo vobis etſi nolim ipſe: cum turbatis, ero pacificus; dabo locum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And there is great <hi>Reaſon</hi> for ſuch a Temper; for every <hi>Difference in Religion</hi> creates not <hi>a different Religion:</hi> While Men do hold the Head, they muſt needs be of the Body. Where the ſame ſubſtantial Doctrine is avowed, accidental variety is very tolerable, eſpecially where the Peace of God's Church is not infringed. It was worthy <hi>Biſhop Reynolds</hi>'s Concluſion, <hi>Where the ſame ſtraight road to Heaven is kept, a ſmall difference of paths hinders not Travellers from coming to the ſame Inn at night:</hi> So neither ſhould they bitterly conteſt about the next way, who ſteadily own the ſame <hi>Guide,</hi> the ſame <hi>Rule,</hi> the ſame <hi>End;</hi> only every one hath not ſo clear an Eye, nor ſuch opportunity to know the more obſcure Points pertaining to the Chriſtian Religion, which others have: Therefore in theſe things <hi>Luther</hi>'s Motto is beſt,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>In quo aliquid Christi video, illum diligo;</hi> where there is any thing of Chriſt, there I love: And this Love will cover, not one or two, but a multitude of ſins and infirmities.</p>

There's a <hi>Defect</hi> of real and fervent <hi>Love,</hi> and an <hi>Exceſs</hi> of <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> within; Self-opinion, Self-will, and Self-intereſt: And this Arrogance breeds Inſolence, and all the biting and devouring menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in this place. Now if theſe two Expreſſions do bear a diſtinct ſignification, then</p>
            <p n="1">1. Men do <hi>Bite</hi> one another by keen and venomous <hi>Words.</hi> When Men do whet their Tongues like a Sword, and bend their bows to ſhoot their Arrows, even bitter words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.3. <hi>The Tongue</hi> (unbridled) <hi>is a fire, a world of Iniquity, it ſets on fire the courſe of Nature, and it is ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> Jam. 3.6. What flames of Strife have the Tongues and Pens of Men kindled and continued in the World!</p>
            <p>Sometimes by <hi>Cenſuring</hi> their Brethren, they are time-ſervers, proud, covetous, ſuperſtitious; or they are conceited, peeviſh, factious: Eſpecially if any one be really ſcandalous, by imputing it preſently to all his Party, as if they were all ſuch, which is the moſt Unjuſt and Uncharitable Inference imaginable; for what Party of Men is there on Earth, wherein there are none that are fooliſh, falſe and wicked? In ſhort, there is no Vice more common and miſchievous, not only among different Parties, but with all ſorts of People, than in their ordinary Converſation to let fly their cenſorious Arrows againſt others; inſomuch as it's very rare to ſpeak of any one behind their back, without ſome reflection upon them, which is not only a biting, but a back-biting one another, and ſo the more baſe and miſchievous.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Men <hi>Bite</hi> one another by plain <hi>Slandering</hi> one another, charging them with Crimes which they abhorr; thus <hi>One</hi> Party rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons all their Oppoſites to be preſently Enemies to the King and to the Church, who on the <hi>Other</hi> ſide are as ready to count them Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and to his People, monopolizing <hi>Godlineſs</hi> to One Party, and <hi>Loyalty</hi> to Another: Nay, each is ready to appropriate all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and good Conſcience to themſelves, and to unſanctifie and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie all of the contrary mind. A common courſe of Hypocrites, firſt to degrade a godly Man into ungodlineſs, that ſo they may have room to hate him. Though the ſame Law, and the ſame Law-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forbids us to <hi>bear falſe witneſs against our Neighbour,</hi> that forbids the <hi>Worſhipping of a graven Image.</hi>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40119:30"/> full of curſing and bitterneſs: But <hi>the wrath of man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> A bad cauſe is never made better, but a good cauſe is alwayes made worſe by ſuch methods. <hi>Adeo inviſa eſt mihi diſcordia</hi> (ſayes <hi>Eraſmus) ut veritas etiam ſeditioſa diſpliceat:</hi> As God's Truth needs not Mans lye, ſo neither doth it need his rancour to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or promote it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men <hi>Devour</hi> one another by <hi>Actual Endeavours</hi> to injure and hurt one another, when their inward rage breaks out into overt Actions, and Practices tending to ruine their Brethren: And this is done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, 1. By <hi>fraud,</hi> which ſignifies all the cunning devices, which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> can ſuggeſt, whereby to undermine their credit, eſtate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Such there were of old, and yet Profeſſors of a true Religion; of whom the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 10.9, 10. <hi>He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his Net: He croucheth and humbleth himſelf, that the poor may fall by his ſtrong ones.</hi> It is endleſs to particularize all the arts and ſleights of uncharitable men each againſt other; but the end is to devour the Eſtates, Lives, Names and Poſterity of others. And is this to <hi>love</hi> your Neighbour <hi>as your ſelves?</hi> or to do as you would be done to? nothing leſs. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this is done by <hi>Force:</hi> When either party can get any <hi>humane Law</hi> on their ſide, down without mercy go all their Oppoſites; yea, ſometimes without it, and beyond it; yea, oftentimes you ſhall ſee them moſt zealous for compliance with one or two Laws, which fit their humour, who live in the continual breach of <hi>twenty</hi> others. All Ages have groan'd under this diſeaſe; what work did not only the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Circumcellians</hi> make of old, when they got power into their hands, but in <hi>latter ages</hi> nothing hath been more common, than the imploying the ſecular arm to the utmoſt by thoſe that could obtain it, to promote their purpoſes. But where is that Dove-like innocence and harmleſneſs this while? <hi>Columbae non ſunt,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,) acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitres ſunt, milvi ſunt, non laniat columba:</hi> And he, though he was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>in writing</hi> againſt the Errors of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> yet profeſt that he had rather be ſlain by them, than occaſion their perſecution unto Death.</p>

But when the Diſtemper lodges at the <hi>Heart,</hi> when that's wounded, when that's divided, the Man dies: And this is not only meant of mans heart divided and diſtracted <hi>from God,</hi> but of Mens hearts divided <hi>from one another,</hi> which it ſhould ſeem was the Caſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time under the reign of <hi>Hoſhea.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Now ſhall they be

And leſt any place, Angle or Iſle in the World ſhould think to eſcape, ſee, 4. The <hi>univerſality</hi> of this Axiom: <hi>Every</hi> Kingdom, <hi>every</hi> City, and <hi>every</hi> Houſe, though the <hi>Kingdom</hi> be never ſo well <hi>peopled,</hi> never ſo well <hi>furniſht,</hi> never ſo well <hi>fortified;</hi> though the <hi>City</hi> be never ſo well <hi>built,</hi> never ſo well <hi>chartered,</hi> never ſo well <hi>traded;</hi> though the <hi>Houſe</hi> be never ſo well <hi>ſituate,</hi> never ſo well <hi>guarded,</hi> never ſo well <hi>adorned;</hi> yet if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants be divided againſt themſelves, they will come to deſolation. But the <hi>Text</hi> in hand is ſufficient to affirm this poſition, <hi>Take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another;</hi> which <hi>Caution</hi> queſtionleſs implies manifeſt danger, and the danger is no leſs than mutual conſumption, or utter periſhing, as you heard before: <hi>Hic enim eſt dimicationis exitus,</hi> as <hi>Grotius;</hi> the end of theſe Contentions, if they be not repented and extinguiſhed, is Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal Ruine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> do atteſt the ſame. For Contentions in <hi>general,</hi> it is evident, that the Diviſions which were among the <hi>Trojans,</hi> made way for their overthrow by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> the like animoſities among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> brought them under the ſlavery of <hi>Philip:</hi> The <hi>Fewds</hi> that were among the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> brought in the <hi>Perſians;</hi> and the like among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſubjected them to the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> and the Contentions among <hi>Alexanders Succeſſours</hi> rendred them up to be ſwallowed by the <hi>Romans</hi> one after another; yea, the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> it ſelf, near the <hi>time when</hi> the Weſtern and the Eaſtern branches of it were hotteſt in Contention about the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and about <hi>Images,</hi> behold the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> deſtroyed the one, and the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:40119:31"/> ruined the other. The ſcandalous diſcords among the <hi>Jews,</hi> expoſed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at length to that dreadful deſolation by <hi>Titus Veſpatian:</hi> And for this <hi>Iſland,</hi> it hath been ſtill accounted like ſome great Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, that can only be ruin'd by it's own ſtrength: The Contentions of the <hi>Britans,</hi> made the <hi>Romans</hi> Conquerours; <hi>Et cum ſinguli pugnant, omnes victi.</hi> Afterwards the <hi>Saxons</hi> came in upon the Diviſions of the <hi>Natives;</hi> and the Contentions of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> prepar'd the way for the <hi>Normans.</hi> And for <hi>Religious</hi> differences, it's known how <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> cheriſhed thoſe between the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> ſaying, That <hi>no ſavage Beaſts were ſo cruel againſt one another, as the Chriſtians;</hi> ſo that he expected thereby to ruine them all. It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious what famous and numerous Churches were once in <hi>Africk,</hi> but by the <hi>Contentions</hi> of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> then of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> they are now extinguiſhed. The <hi>Contentions</hi> among the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi>'s Reign, ended in the Perſecution by <hi>Queen Mary:</hi> and if ever the <hi>Romans</hi> ruine us again, it will be procured by our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> among our ſelves. It is but reaſonable to leave thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the <hi>dark,</hi> who will be ſtill fighting about the <hi>Candle;</hi> and it will be juſt with God to force them to agree in <hi>Red,</hi> that are ſtill bickering about <hi>Black and White.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> party may think to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the <hi>other,</hi> but both are like to rue it; and they that have been complices in <hi>guilt,</hi> muſt look to be companions in the <hi>puniſhment.</hi> By all which you may ſee whither theſe <hi>uncharitable Contentions</hi> do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tend, and where they are like to end: And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is too much <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it. 1. <hi>Ex parte Rei.</hi> Theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions have a natural <hi>tendency</hi> to promote our deſtruction; nothing can more properly bring it to effect. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They <hi>weaken</hi> that <hi>Confidence</hi> that is neceſſary for the preſervation of a People. Jealouſie is the great bane of Families, Churches and Nations, but a mutual confidence eſtabliſhes them. How can thoſe that <hi>bite and devour one another,</hi> confide in one another? And if the Parts be thus ill-affected, how crazy muſt the whole Body be? When we can ſee little or nothing amiſs in a Perſon, or in an Action, and yet do ſuſpect that there is ſomething concealed, even this creates a diſtruſt, and weakens the welfare of the whole; much more when ſuſpicions are boiled up into actual diſſention, it muſt needs expoſe ſuch a Church and Nation to the utmoſt peril. For then men preſently put the worſt conſtruction upon each other, and upon all their words and actions. You know every thing hath two handles; we <hi>ſhould</hi> take every thing by the charitable handle, and if it be capable of a fair and friendly ſence, ſo we ſhould receive it; for ſo we deſire in all Caſes to be underſtood: we would not be alway interpreted in the worſt ſence, and why then ſhould we deal ſo with others? <hi>Charity thinketh no evil.</hi> It's true, it behoves <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> to be watchfull, and to ſtand much upon their guard, for the prevention of publick dangers; but with private perſons to put ill interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon one anothers words or carriage, argues <hi>ill Nature</hi> and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:40119:32"/> of Spirit; and this humour greatly weakens that confidence which is neceſſary to the happineſs of any people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They <hi>deſtroy</hi> that <hi>Love</hi> which is the Cement of all Societies. As they proceed from a defect of Love, ſo they quite ruine the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it. Now this love unites, and ſo ſtrengthens: but when mens <hi>Hearts</hi> are once divided from each other, what care I what becomes of them I hate? That made that <hi>Scythian Scilurus</hi> when he was on his Death-bed, to cauſe a bundle of Javelins to be brought and laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>eighty</hi> Sons, who being commanded to break the whole bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, could not poſſibly do it; but when they were untied, they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily broke them one after another: teaching them thereby to cleave to one another, and that their <hi>Diviſion</hi> would be their <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> Hereupon it is worth our notice, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> when he muſters up the <hi>works of the Fleſh</hi> in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>Nine</hi> kinds of them are contrary to this <hi>Love,</hi> to wit, <hi>Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, murders:</hi> And when the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit</hi> are reckon'd, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. behold how many of them are a-kin to this <hi>Love</hi> which I am ſpeaking of. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, meekneſs:</hi> As if the carnal man were compoſed only of <hi>Flame,</hi> and the ſpiritual man made up of <hi>Benignity:</hi> But ſuch unkind Contentions, like ruſt or canker, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this love; and ſo each part looking only to it ſelf, there is none that take care of the whole; and ſo, as by <hi>Concord</hi> ſmall things increaſe, ſo by <hi>Diſcord</hi> great things waſt to nothing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They <hi>prepare</hi> for the moſt <hi>deſperate Actions.</hi> For when there is a diſlike ſettled within, and that mens ſpirits are exaſperated by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking words and actions, there wants nothing but opportunity to produce the moſt violent effects. The <hi>Text</hi> ſeems to give warning hereof, by ſaying, <hi>Take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Whomſoever you thus bite and provoke, may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be tempted to <hi>revenge</hi> it, and ſo you will fall foul upon one another: your common Enemies may well think and ſay, Let them alone, they'l tear one another in pieces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Behold the ſparks of Civil War, and what elſe but ruine can follow ſuch premiſes? We undertake hereby to be our own Executioners, and ſpare our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the pains of deſtroying us. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you, come they not from hence, even of your luſts, that war in your members?</hi> And hereupon that following advice is given; <hi>Speak not evil one of another, brethren: He that ſpeaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, ſpeaketh evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law,</hi> Jam. 4.1.11. And it hath been obſerved, that Religious Fewds (the more is the pity) are generally the moſt fierce and violent; whether becauſe the beſt things being corrupted, prove the worſt; or that miſtaken Conſcience, and miſguided Zeal do hurry men to the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; and that people think that they can never be too earneſt and vigorous in their actings for God; <hi>John</hi> 16.2. <hi>The time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice.</hi> How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40119:32"/> muſt thoſe Bigotts and thoſe Zealots be to one another, that believe they ſerve God <hi>beſt,</hi> when they hate and miſchief one another <hi>worſt?</hi> No perſecution from without can be ſo fatal to the Church of God, as the ſtrugglings in her Womb: As no ſtorms or tempeſts do rend and tear the Earth ſo much, as the convulſions that are within it. And as their Uncharitable Contentions do thus <hi>Ex parte Rei,</hi> procure,</p>
            <p>So 2. They do <hi>Ex parte Dei, deſerve Deſtruction;</hi> and therefore they do plainly prepare for it. 1. They do provoke the Wrath of God. God is Love, he is the God of Peace, and then theſe muſt evidently offend and croſs his Bleſſed Nature. The more patient, quiet and mild men are, the liker are they to God, and the more uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and implacable, the liker to the Devil, the Accuſer of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. When our dear <hi>Saviour,</hi> who came on purpoſe to reconcile God and Man, and men to men; The <hi>Anthem</hi> which was ſung by <hi>Angels,</hi> was, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, on Earth peace, and good-will unto men.</hi> Theſe Contentions do ring theſe Bells backward, and chaſe away that peace and good-will back to Heaven again. When <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was ſo kind to his guilty Brethren, as to be reconciled to them, he ſent them back again with this charge, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 45.24. <hi>See that ye fall not out by the way;</hi> q. d. See, I am reconciled to you all, quarrel not among your ſelves; a moſt kind and equal advice! In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he had obtained Remiſſion for us, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his Diſciples <hi>to have ſalt in themſelves, and to have peace one with aaother;</hi> he renews no Commandment, but that of loving one another: And the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> doth ſtill inculcate this Leſſon above all others, to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, to be like minded, to have the ſame Love, to do nothing through ſtrife or vain-glory, to avoid the provoking one another. Now how inexcuſable doth this leave all fiery and contentious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? And how juſtly may they be handled without any <hi>Mercy,</hi> that handle their brethren without any <hi>Charity?</hi> And certainly, as the Lord commands a bleſſing upon Brethren that dwell together in unity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. ſo it is a manifeſt token of his wrath, when a ſpirit of diſſention is ſent upon People; when <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> is ſet againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h,</hi> and they <hi>together againſt Judah,</hi> then it follows, <hi>for all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill:</hi> Iſa. 9.21. And look as the Husbandman deals with his way-ward Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, when they cannot agree in the <hi>Field,</hi> he pounds them up, and makes them quiet in the <hi>Fold;</hi> ſo may our Juſt and Holy God make all thoſe that cannot unite in the <hi>Church,</hi> to agree at the <hi>Stake.</hi> As <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who fell into ſuch debate when they were in Priſon for the ſame Cauſe, that they refuſed to hold communion together, till they both at length agreed in Red. And ſo two other <hi>learned men</hi> were at ſuch diſcord in the <hi>Mines,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were condemn'd for Chriſtianity, that they made up a Wall between their Works, to keep them aſunder, till at laſt they met at the fatal Pile.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:33"/>2. They <hi>conſume the Power and Life of Godlineſs.</hi> God's grace never thrives in an unquiet Spirit. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay that <hi>Jehovah</hi> lives in <hi>Salem,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Peace;</hi> but he cannot live in <hi>Babel,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi> That Zeal, that Time, thoſe Studies which ſhould be employed in the increaſing of ſaving Knowledge, Faith, Hope and Holineſs, they are all conſum'd in theſe <hi>uncharitable Contentions.</hi> Inſtead of making our own <hi>Calling and Election ſure,</hi> we are buſie to <hi>reprobrate</hi> our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to render their <hi>Calling ineffectual:</hi> Inſtead of <hi>conſidering one another to provoke to Love and good Works,</hi> theſe engage us to conſider all the defects and faults of others, and to provoke them to Anger, and to every evil Work. This is <hi>faſting for ſtrife and debate;</hi> theſe imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Prayers, and hinder our acceſs to God, when we cannot lift up unto him <hi>holy hands without wrath,</hi> nor <hi>without doubting;</hi> yea, they'll tempt us to reſtrain Prayer before God, or to do, as Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> tells of <hi>ſome,</hi> that would not ſay the <hi>Lord's-Prayer</hi> at all, leſt they ſhould be thereby obliged to forgive others; and therefore in the ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of went to our <hi>Ladies Pſalter.</hi> How can ſuch approach the <hi>Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that will make no agreement with their Adverſaries? that will not forgive, that deſire not to be forgiven? In ſhort, where <hi>envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work. But the Wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated — And the fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace of them that make peace,</hi> Jam. 3.16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>It will be <hi>Objected</hi> here, That it is our Duty, where we have <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> on our ſide, to <hi>contend earneſtly.</hi> So they were exhorted, Jude 3. <hi>to contend earneſtly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> To be cool or lukewarm, is to betray and ſell the Truth; and this Neutrality becomes no man in the Cauſe of Truth.</p>
            <p>To this I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. We muſt conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Conſequence</hi> of Truth; that is, that it be a <hi>great</hi> or <hi>neceſſary</hi> Truth: For though no Truth muſt be <hi>deny'd,</hi> yet many Truths may be <hi>forborn.</hi> If every Man ſhould be oblig'd to vent and propagate <hi>at all times</hi> every thing which he holds to be true, no place or converſation would be quiet. It was a Truth that a Believer might <hi>eat all things,</hi> yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not think it neceſſary to urge or inſiſt upon it, nor that it would quit the coſt of a <hi>doubtful diſputation,</hi> Rom. 14.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In aſſerting any Truth a Man may be <hi>earneſt,</hi> and yet <hi>charitable:</hi> he may think well of his Oppoſites, and yet think ill of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; he may oppoſe an error with a ſpirit of meekneſs, with ſoft words and hard arguments: An excellent direction there is for this; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.23, 24, 25. <hi>But fooliſh and unlearned queſtions avoid, knowing that they do gender ſtrifes: And the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient: In meekneſs instructing thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves.</hi> This is far from aggravating mens miſtakes, ſpinning out odious conſequences from them, concluding that all of another perſwaſion do militate againſt their own Conſciences, that worldly intereſt or vain Humour ſwayes them, that they are ignorant Sotts,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40119:33"/> or ſuperſtitious Time-ſervers, (and the like;) theſe kind of ſtrivings are not for any Servant of the Lord. When <hi>Michael</hi> had the worſt of all adverſaries to diſpute with, he durſt not bring againſt him a railing accuſation, but ſaid, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Jude</hi> 9. And if a little railing might not be mixt in a Diſpute with the Devil himſelf, how dare any man uſe it againſt any one of the ſame Nature, Nation, and Religion with himſelf? Moſt piouſly therefore was it reſolved by divers eminent <hi>German Divines,</hi> who met at <hi>Marpurg,</hi> to diſcuſs the point of the Real Preſence, that though they could not accord therein, yet that they would <hi>preſerve the bond of Charity inviolable among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, but you <hi>Object,</hi> That our <hi>Oppoſites</hi> are <hi>violent;</hi> and if we be gentle, we ſhall but incourage them: Shall they be hot in the <hi>wrong,</hi> and we lukewarm in the <hi>right?</hi> How can we handle charitably, ſuch uncharitable perſons?</p>
            <p>Unto this I <hi>Anſwer:</hi> We may be <hi>reſolute,</hi> and yet <hi>charitable,</hi> for one Grace never croſſes another: As the greateſt <hi>Courage</hi> is ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the greateſt <hi>generouſneſs</hi> to an Adverſary, ſo the warmeſt <hi>zeal,</hi> if true, is attended with the pureſt <hi>Charity;</hi> otherwiſe it is but <hi>Rage</hi> and Brutiſhneſs which is very forreign to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> temper. Where true Grace is <hi>impreſſed</hi> on the Soul, there graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and kindneſs will be <hi>expreſſed</hi> to all men. When all is ſaid and done, all true Chriſtians are <hi>ſworn Brethren,</hi> and muſt love and bear with one another. <hi>Proh dolor!</hi> (S. <hi>Cyprian) quid facit in corde Chriſtianorum luporum feritas &amp; canum rabies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> can never cure <hi>violence:</hi> As the wrath of Man works not the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> ſo neither doth it work the <hi>Reformution of men:</hi> One ſin can never work a right cure upon another. We ſee this in our ſelves, ſeverity and violence cures no body; and this ſhould be mens deſign in all Arguments, Diſputes and Reproofs, namely, to recover and cure thoſe that are out of the way; but <hi>durum ſuper durum non facit murum:</hi> Hence the expreſſion of that peaceable <hi>Biſhop Hall,</hi> 
               <q>I am, and profeſs to be, as the terms ſtand, on neither, and yet on both parts; for the peace of both, for the humour of neither: how ſhould mortar cement, if it lie not between both ſtones? The Kingdom of God ſtands not in meats, in colours, in noiſes, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures; God ſtands not on ſuch trifles, and why ſhould we?</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Wiſeſt of men</hi> determines this: <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.33. <hi>The wringing of the noſe bringeth forth blood; ſo the forcing of wrath bringeth forth ſtrife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but <hi>God's Glory</hi> (you'l ſay) is at the ſtake! therefore it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>lawful</hi> to be zealous, but <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, 1. Be <hi>ſure it be ſo,</hi> that the Honour of God be really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in theſe your <hi>Contentions:</hi> It is a dangerous thing to ingage <hi>God's Glory</hi> in our ſinful affections or expreſſions. You know how dear it coſt <hi>Moſes</hi> that Servant of the <hi>Lord,</hi> when in great heat againſt his erring Brethren, he brake out <hi>unadviſedly with his lips,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.10. <hi>Hear now, ye Rebels, must we fetch you water out of this Rock?</hi> Though otherwiſe he was the <hi>meekeſt man upon Earth,</hi> and was at
<pb facs="tcp:40119:34"/> that time ſufficiently provoked, yet <hi>Almighty God</hi> would not bear to hear this language from him, and ſhut him out of the promiſed land for it. God knows, we are more apt to preſs <hi>God's Glory</hi> into the ſervice of our Paſſions and Intereſts, than to ingage our ſelves, and all our abilities, or to deny our humours, for the promoting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be it known to you, that though your <hi>Ends</hi> be very ſincere, yet <hi>God's Glory</hi> hath no need of your <hi>Intemperance.</hi> As his <hi>Truth</hi> hath no need of our <hi>Lye,</hi> ſo his Honour needs not the rotten pillars of mens paſſions: <hi>Job</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>Will ye ſpeak wickedly for God? and talk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully for him? Will ye accept His Perſon? Will ye contend for God?</hi> He requires it not, he needs it not. The excellency of the <hi>end</hi> will not legitimate the vitiouſneſs of the <hi>means;</hi> nay, by <hi>breaking his Law</hi> in theſe uncharitable Contentions <hi>you diſhonour him.</hi> God's Truth and Honour have almoſt ſuffered as much by weak and <hi>paſſionate Advocates,</hi> as by <hi>open Adverſaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If you be indeed ſo concern'd for God's Glory, and for his Truth, then you will <hi>uſe all other means</hi> to reduce men into the way of Truth. His Glory muſt be promoted by his own means; you will not only rebuke them, but you'l pray for them; you'l ſpeak as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly for them <hi>to God</hi> in Heaven, as you ſpeak <hi>againſt them</hi> upon Earth. If they hunger, you will feed them; if they be diſparaged or diſtreſs'd, you will aſſiſt them; and thus by <hi>heaping coals of fire upon their heads,</hi> you will melt them into Repentance; you are not ignorant that the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering <hi>Winds</hi> make the <hi>Traveller</hi> gird his Cloak cloſer to him, when the warm <hi>Sun</hi> forces him to lay it aſide: And men generally will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en themſelves in their Opinions, when they are only pelted with <hi>wrath</hi> and rancour, who may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, when they are inſtructed with <hi>meekneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. For <hi>Application.</hi> 1. Then it follows, That <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the true means of our Preſervation.</hi> Unity of <hi>Judgment,</hi> this I ſay <hi>again</hi> ſhould be endeavoured, not only in weighty Points, but in all matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice: And if men would labour to diveſt themſelves of <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> this might in a great meaſure be obtain'd. <hi>Truth</hi> is but <hi>One;</hi> and if all did truly ſeek Truth, they would <hi>ſurely</hi> find it: <hi>The integrity of the upright ſhall guide them,</hi> and, <hi>the righteouſneſs of the perfect ſhall direct his way;</hi> Prov. 11.3.5. But a violent <hi>Prejudice</hi> for or againſt any Opinion or Practice, is a notorious hinderance in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Truth; it ſhuts the windows that light cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nter: Whoſo therefore would find out the <hi>plain Truth,</hi> muſt ſtrip himſelf of all ſuch <hi>pre-occupation,</hi> as will not ſuffer him to make an impartial ſearch into the Mind of God about it; and having found it, muſt render himſelf priſoner unto it. So alſo muſt all worldly <hi>Interests</hi> be laid at the feet of Truth, and whether the Doctrine or Practice in queſtion be in repute or under diſgrace, whether it will gain or loſe my beſt Friends, whether it will preferr or undoe me, are not Conſiderations worthy of him that hath learned to <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40119:34"/> to value the <hi>World to come</hi> above the Word <hi>that now is:</hi> I ſay again, if men did but ſincerely <hi>ſeek,</hi> they ſhould certainly <hi>find,</hi> according to <hi>Christ's</hi> Promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7. and ſo <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Judgment,</hi> would be attain'd more than it is, which doubtleſs would be a ſoveraign Preſervative from <hi>Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is another <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> which is in <hi>Affection,</hi> and that is <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which is of no leſs Excellency and Uſe to our preſervation. There may be many, who may call for Unity, not for <hi>Truths</hi> ſake, but for their own. As <hi>Muſculus</hi> obſerves upon the <hi>Soldiers,</hi> that would not divide our Saviours <hi>ſeamleſs Coat;</hi> but it was not out of any reſpect to <hi>Him,</hi> but hoping every one, that it would fall to his Lot: So many cry out for Unity, ſaith he, not out of Love to the Truth or Unity, but in expectation that the ſtream ſhall run in their own Channel. But now <hi>Charity,</hi> as it would be in all material things on Truths ſide, ſo in things more diſputable it can bear ſome contradiction: and ſo concludes, In the <hi>Substance</hi> of Chriſtianity, he that is not with us, is againſt us; in things <hi>Indifferent,</hi> he that is not againſt us, is for us: And to promote this among <hi>our ſelves,</hi> I mean, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Protestants in theſe Nations,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us conſider, 1. <hi>How many things we agree in.</hi> And if men would begin at this end, and not ſtill at the wrong end, to wit, the few and ſmall things wherein we differ, we could not for very <hi>ſhame</hi> be ſo implacable to one another. We agree in the acknowledgment of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of God againſt <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Epicures;</hi> In the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> againſt <hi>Mahometans;</hi> we agree about the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Natures,</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of our Redeemer, againſt all <hi>Hereticks</hi> both <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New:</hi> In ſhort, we agree in the ſame <hi>Creeds,</hi> in all the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of the Chriſtian Doctrine; yea, we agree in the <hi>Substance</hi> of the ſame <hi>Worſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

And if Unity in the Truth be any ground for Love and Charity, it is incomprehenſible, that they who agree in all theſe things, ſhould be more inveterate againſt one another, than againſt ſuch as differ not <hi>toto Caelo,</hi> but <hi>toto tartaro</hi> from them both! But it is obſerved, that the nearer <hi>ſome men</hi> are to a conjunction, ſome difference remaining, the greater is their hatred; thus a <hi>Jew</hi> hates a <hi>Christian,</hi> more than he doth a <hi>Pagan;</hi> and a <hi>Papist</hi> hates a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> worſe than he doth a <hi>Jew;</hi> and a nominal <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> hates a <hi>Puritan</hi> more than he doth a <hi>Papist,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> notes): <hi>The Contention of Brethren are like the Bars of a Castle:</hi> Prov. 18.19. A moſt unreaſonable, though a very common thing!</p>

Why ſhould we condemn every one that is not endowed with our <hi>Abilities,</hi> or advanced to our <hi>Capacity?</hi> Do we fall out with one that is purblind, becauſe he cannot ſee ſo far, nor ſo quick as we? we ſhould rather pity him, and praiſe <hi>God</hi> who hath been kinder to us. They that are moſt intelligent, know but in part. And <hi>if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.2. That was therefore a good <hi>Anſwer</hi> which <hi>Melanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon</hi> made to thoſe who objected to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> their <hi>Diviſions;</hi> ſaith he, <q>The judicious agree in fundamentals; but as in a great Army, the skill or ſtrength of all the Captains and of all the Soldiers is not equal, but they all agree in their wills and honeſt deſigns to ſerve their Prince; ſo all good men have not the like knowledge, but all agree in their ſincere love to goodneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, that you who are ſo violent, do <hi>differ from others,</hi> juſt <hi>as far</hi> as they <hi>differ from you.</hi> Do you think that one kind of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> is beſt? they do as verily think ſo of another: do you hold ſuch and ſuch <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Religion to be unlawful? they are as confident of the lawfulneſs of them. Do you conclude, that all Private mens Opinions in ſuch matters ought to be ſwallowed up, and to acquieſce in the publick Determination? they verily believe that the Church ſhould leave them, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, in their firſt <hi>Indifference.</hi> Now when ſuch, as do not otherwiſe forfeit their Veracity, come and profeſs that they cannot for their Hearts think otherwiſe than they do; you cannot yield to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cannot comply with you, what remedy then is ſo proper, ſo Chriſtian, as <hi>Charity</hi> to each other? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon that Promiſe, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.15. <hi>If in any thing ye be oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="4">4.

If Uncharitable Contentions do prepare for utter Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Then <hi>Woe be to the Inſtruments and Bellows of our Contentions:</hi> If the <hi>Evil</hi> of them be ſo great, if the <hi>Danger</hi> from them be ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then moſt wicked and wretched are the promoters of them. <hi>Wo to the World becauſe of offences, for it muſt needs be that offences come; but Woe to that Man by whom the offence cometh,</hi> Matth. 18.7.

            <p n="1">1. Our common Adverſary and Enemy in this matter is <hi>Satan.</hi> Our Contentions do plainly ſmell of fire and brimſtone.

<pb facs="tcp:40119:37"/> their Leaders would appoint them a meeting before Sun-ſet, and cauſe them to embrace one another. But we have many to puſh us on, and few to moderate us in our Contentions. We tear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pieces; and if any interpoſe, he is ſtigmatiz'd for a Neuter, or elſe meets with the Parter's portion, to wit, blows on both ſides; he finds <hi>Livie</hi>'s Obſervation but too true, that <hi>Media via neque amicos pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit nec inimicos tollit.</hi> Hear Holy <hi>Augustine</hi> in the like Caſe to <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who were in Contention. <q>Woe is me that I cannot find you nearer together! how am I moved, how do I grieve, what fear am I in!

Our <hi>Common Enemy is ready to devour us.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Lot, Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, between me and thee, for we be brethren,</hi> that the <hi>Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land,</hi> Gen. 13.7, 8. that if the Relation of <hi>Brethren</hi> would not ſway his Kinſman, yet the reproach and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that might fall upon them both from the <hi>Canaanite</hi> and the <hi>Perizzite</hi> might check any further breach between them. We have the <hi>Canaanites</hi> both within the Land and without, that are ready to make one morſel of us, and who after we have condemned one another for Superſtition and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> will truſs us all up for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> without the infinite Mercy of God. Now even <hi>Antipathies</hi> are laid aſide in common dangers, as it is probable that all the Creatures, though of contrary diſpoſitions, agreed in the <hi>Ark:</hi> And yet we cannot, in this our common peril, agree with our own Countrey-men. <hi>Luther</hi> tells of <hi>two Goats,</hi> that meeting upon a narrow Plank over a deep River, whereby they could neither turn back nor paſs by; the one of them lyes down, that the other going over him, they might both eſcape the danger. If meer Nature can teach theſe poor Creatures to yield ſo far to one another, to prevent the Ruine of both; furely <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and eſpecialy <hi>God's Grace</hi> being ſuperadded, ſhould teach each different Party, in common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to ſtrive which ſhould ſubmit to other, in what poſſibly they can, to preſerve the whole. It is evident, that we all have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an unmerciful Enemy, who as they have long abetted our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſo they build their greateſt hopes upon the continuance of them; and although they may carry fairer to one ſide than to another, yet even ſuch muſt only expect to be uſed by them as <hi>

            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>baſeneſs</hi> of the Sin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You break the great Command of God's Law,</hi> which is <hi>Love.</hi> For next to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> is the Love of our <hi>Neighbour;</hi> and they are ſo conjoyn'd, that the one cannot exiſt without the other: <hi>For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20. When therefore you think you are zealous for <hi>God,</hi> by this kind of managery you are breaking his Laws. Yea, you break the <hi>Royal Law,</hi> which Commands you to <hi>Love your Neighbour as your ſelves,</hi> Jam. 2.8. and no other Devotion, Preciſeneſs or Charity will anſwer for this Defect; as it follws <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point,</hi> (referring to this very fault) <hi>he is guilty of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You trample upon the great Precept of the Goſpel,</hi> which is <hi>Love.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>And this is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us Commandment.</hi> See here, <hi>Commandment</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Verſe,</hi> and <hi>Commandment</hi> again in the <hi>end</hi> of it; and then it's joyn'd, and goes hand in hand with <hi>Faith in Jeſus Christ;</hi> ſo that you may as ſafely be without the one as without the other. And again 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21. <hi>And this Commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother alſo.</hi> Now what Love can there be in the Heart, when there is nothing but reproach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and rage, in the Tongue, in the Pen, and in the Carriage? It is certain, <hi>That out of the abundance of the Heart, the Tongue ſpeaks;</hi> and the Lungs muſt needs be corrupt within, when ſuch purulent matter is expectorated. <hi>Say not,</hi> that your <hi>Love to the Truth,</hi> or to the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> muſt regulate your behaviour to particular Perſons: For neither the <hi>Truth</hi> nor the <hi>Publick good</hi> do need your uncharitable words or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> had great <hi>Truths</hi> to declare, and great <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> to oppoſe, yet <hi>He did not ſtrive, nor cry, neither did any man hear his Voice in the ſtreets,</hi> Mat. 12.19. And as <hi>Lactantius</hi> argued with the <hi>Heathens, Vel Ethnici Christianos ſapientes judicant, vel ſtultos; tamen non vel ſapientes imitantur, vel ſtultis parcunt.</hi> So either your Oppoſites are either wiſe or fooliſh: If wiſe, you ſhould comply with them, reſpect and reverence them; if fooliſh, you ſhould forbear and pity them: But whatſoever they are, you ought intirely to love them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Contentions do <hi>bring great diſhonour to Jeſus Christ.</hi> He is the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> the true <hi>King of Salem;</hi> the great Promoter of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:38"/> Peace, and the great pattern of it. When he came into the World, <hi>Peace</hi> was ſung, when he departed out of the World, <hi>Peace</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed. Now this quarrelſome temper in his Servants doth griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect upon him. For he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them that ſhall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one —That the world may believe that thou hast ſent me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Their diſſentions and quarrels will tempt men to think that I came not from thee, who art the Mirrour of Wiſdom and Love. He imployed all his Sacred Breath, to pluck men out of the power of the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, to promote Faith, Repentance, and Holineſs, and to guide our feet <hi>into the way of peace.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Apostles</hi> tell us, That <hi>the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Let not us therefore diſhonour our Redeemer, let us not calculate a new Goſpel, let us not lay too great a ſtreſs on ſmall matters, let us not provoke men to think, that our great Maſter came to <hi>tithe mint, anyſe</hi> and <hi>cummin,</hi> who came about far other work, and taught us far greater matters. It is recorded of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> an Heathen <hi>Emperour,</hi> that ſeeing two Chriſtians contending, he forbad them to aſſume the name of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> upon them, for that by their quarrelling they diſgraced their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. How many now by this <hi>Rule</hi> would be interdicted <hi>that worthy Name?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe Uncharitable Contentions do <hi>grieve the Holy Spirit of God.</hi> He deſcended like a <hi>Dove,</hi> and cannot brook the gall of bitterneſs. When therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> had dehorted the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> c. 4.30. from <hi>griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Spirit of God,</hi> he adds in the <hi>next verſe, Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted,</hi> &amp;c. This ſweet <hi>Dove</hi> will never lodge in a <hi>Vultures</hi> neſt. You heard the <hi>fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace,</hi> &amp;c. And whatſoever pretences any may make to the Spirit, if they do not verifie them by a meek, loving, and charitable behaviour to others, they abuſe the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and deceive others. For as nothing is more grateful to this good Spirit, than Love and Peace, ſo nothing more diſtaſtfull than Wrath and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe Contentions do <hi>ſtir up much Corruption,</hi> both in the <hi>Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour</hi> and the <hi>Defendant.</hi> There is a great deal of folly in the wiſeſt and beſt of men, and this either lurks in the habit, or is produc'd into Act, more or leſs, as there is greater or leſſer temptation. Sin dwells in our Natures, as the mud in the bottom of a glaſs of water; when it is ſhaken, it appears and ſtains the whole glaſs. There is a world of pride, anger; envy and revenge in mens hearts, and theſe Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons draw them forth, ſtrengthen them, and make them rampant. <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.21. <hi>As Coals to burning Coals, and wood to fire, ſo is a contentious man to kindle ſtrife.</hi> So that the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> concludes, <hi>That he loveth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, that loveth ſtrife,</hi> Prov. 19.19. And hereupon ſome have made obſervations upon the deaths of <hi>Biſhop Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop Hooper,</hi> that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40119:38"/> they ſuffered with more torture than others, and that becauſe of their Contentions together before.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They do greatly <hi>hinder the Converſion of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi> and the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Holineſs of the Godly.</hi> Whereas the great work of <hi>God's Miniſters</hi> ſhould be to inſtruct the ignorant, to convince and reform the profane, to build up God's Children in their Faith and Holineſs; this ſhould be their ſtudy in private, this their buſineſs in publick: Now the ignorant and ungodly are left quiet in their ſins, the Sober and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are little improv'd in their Chriſtian courſe, and mens Talents of Time, Parts and Pains, are laid out in dry and unprofitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. And then <hi>private</hi> perſons, who ſhould imploy their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe together to their mutual edification, they are perpetually irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating one another by theſe fruitleſs Contentions.. I have heard of a <hi>Monſter</hi> born in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> with two Heads and one Body, which two heads would be ſtill arguing and knocking each other in eager diſputes, (too fit an Emblem of this diſputing Age!) But we that have but one <hi>Bleſſed Head,</hi> yet the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are alwayes contending among themſelves. Inſtead of exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we are cenſuring; inſtead of reproving, we are reproaching; inſtead of provoking to Love and good works, we provoke one another to wrath and diſcontent. And then for the devout uſe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> doubtleſs theſe wrathfull Contentions muſt needs greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb it. For if Husband and Wife ſhould maintain a conſtant amity, that their <hi>Prayers be not hindred,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.7. a continual conteſting with our Brethren muſt greatly clog and damp them. Whereupon <hi>Cyprian,</hi> citing thoſe words of our <hi>Saviour, When two agree on Earth to ask,</hi> &amp;c. hath this Obſervation, <hi>Plus impetrari poteſt paucorum concordi prece, quam diſcordi oratione multorum.</hi> A few in concord ſhall obtain more than many in diſcord.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Theſe Contentions in Religion <hi>tempt men to be Atheiſts.</hi> When they read and hear ſuch unmercifull rage in <hi>Chriſtians</hi> one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that they who profeſs agreement in <hi>nineteen</hi> things, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anathemize one another about the <hi>twentieth;</hi> what a ſtumbling-block muſt it needs be unto weak and unreſolved perſons, and tempt them to throw aſide <hi>all</hi> Religion? So <hi>Optatus</hi> obſerved of old in the like Caſe, <hi>Vos dicitis, Licet; nos dicimus, Non licet: Inter licet veſtrum, &amp; non licet noſtrum, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is bound upon peril of everlaſting damnation to <hi>win Chriſt,</hi> and be <hi>found in him,</hi> to <hi>work out his own Salvation,</hi> and to ſet about it without delay: Now what a weak thing is it for any man to refuſe or neglect this neceſſary work, becauſe ſome men are not agreed about a <hi>Geſture</hi> or a <hi>Ceremony?</hi> Such fools ſhall <hi>dye in their ſin,</hi> but their blood ſhall be required at their hands, who have been a ſcandal to them.</p>

We account it barbarous rudeneſs in diſcourſing, yea, or in diſcuſſing any point, to ſignifie in civil company the leaſt provoking geſture, much more to fall into a rage or to expreſs revenge: And yet if you hear the Harangues, and read the printed diſcourſes of ſome <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> you would conclude that they have but a ſmall pittance either of <hi>good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> or of <hi>ingenious Education.</hi> Man is a rational Creature, and is not born with Teeth, nor form'd with Sting or with Horns, neither is he teachable or ductile by ſuch boiſterous methods.

Conſider the <hi>Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Sadneſs of the Danger.</hi> You were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the <hi>Certainty</hi> of Ruine from theſe Contentions in the <hi>fourth</hi> Propoſition, that it is in vain to expect ſafety, to be exempted from the calamity threatned. Do but weigh this very <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that determination of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Matth. 12. and you will conclude, That nothing but a miraculous interpoſition of God's Power and Mercy can prevent it. As when a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is in its nature and degree mortal, the <hi>Phyſician</hi> adviſeth the Man to ſettle his Conſcience and Eſtate, for his danger is imminent; ſo when we ſee that Charity broken, which is the <hi>Girdle</hi> that binds a Nation together; when we ſee the <hi>black and blew ſpots</hi> of Rancour and Revenge on the faces and looks, and in the words and carriage of ſo many, it ſufficiently proclaims our danger; that if we eſcape more ſudden and violent deſtruction, yet we are ſure of a Conſumption. <hi>Take heed ye be not conſumed one of other.</hi> And though you may be dead in your own Perſons, before this denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take effect, yet you will, ſo far as guilty herein, intail ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine upon the Generation to come. And if you would but conſider, that you muſt be ſick, and dye your ſelves, at which time in all likelihood, you will have different apprehenſions of theſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; when Conſcience ſhews you the Hiſtory of your ſinfull Life, and diſcovers an Holy God, before whom you muſt immediately appear, and the ſtrict account which you muſt preſently give, and the Ocean of Eternity which is juſt before you, then you'l ſee that theſe other points were but of ſmall moment in compariſon, and not worth that heat and vigour you ſpent upon them.

What <hi>Decay of Trade,</hi> what <hi>breaking of Trades-men,</hi> what <hi>ſinking of the Rents of Land,</hi> and what a general <hi>Conſumption</hi> invades us. The Judgments of God are already <hi>as a mouth to us,</hi> well if they break not forth as a <hi>Lion</hi> upon us, as was once threatned and fulfilled upon <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 12.14.

            <p>The <hi>Providence</hi> of God hath ſeveral times moſt expreſly called us to Unity, to Charity, and to Concord. In the <hi>Year</hi> 1660. our general Union in <hi>Civils,</hi> and our general <hi>Flexibleneſs</hi> to a mutual agreement in Religious matters, was a plain direction of Providence to us to bury our debate and ſtrife, and to put up the Temporal and Spiritual Sword together. But we have been biting and devouring one another ever ſince, now almoſt thirty <hi>years.</hi> When it pleaſed God to contend from Heaven with us by the <hi>Plague,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> and to permit men to contend with us by <hi>Warr,</hi> it was a ſufficient <hi>Item</hi> to us to make our Peace with God, and to be at peace among our ſelves: but we have been biting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another for all that. In the <hi>Year</hi> 1678, when there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared deep and ſtrong deſigns and endeavours to ſubvert Religion, and to bury both Parties in the ſame grave: Divine Providence did thereby articulately call to us to lay our quarrels to ſleep, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially to joyn our Prayers and Endeavours in our places to reſcue our common Faith from ſo great a danger; but yet we have been ſince that time, biting and devouring one another, as ſharply as ever before. And now <hi>once more</hi> we have a fair <hi>Call,</hi> and each Party hath profeſſed a ſerious <hi>Inclination</hi> to unite together againſt our common Adverſaries. God forbid that our Prejudices, Humours or Intereſts ſhould ſtill hinder ſo great a Bleſſing!</p>
            <p>I come now, in the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> place, to direct the beſt <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to cure this great Evil, and to prevent this great Danger.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Lament your own and others ſin in this particular.</hi> All ſound Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begins in godly ſorrow. We are glowing hot in wrath and ſtrife, Tears are neceſſary to quench this Flame; mourn for others fierceneſs and for your own. For the <hi>Diviſions of Reuben; let there be great ſearchings of heart.</hi> When we are once truly humbled and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent before God, our Brethren will have better quarter from us. Conſider, how often you have added fewel to this fire, how you have exaſperated this burning <hi>Fever,</hi> and how little you have done to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage and mitigate it. How eaſily you have been prejudiced, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily provok'd, how hardly pacified. If you ſhould have met with ſuch treatment from your Heavenly <hi>Father,</hi> as your <hi>Brethren</hi> have had from you, you had been devour'd and conſum'd long ago.. Do not think that needleſs Diviſions in Chriſts Church, is ſo light a fault,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40119:40"/> that reproaches and revilings are venial ſins; when <hi>Our Saviour</hi> hath aſſured us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6. <hi>That it were better for him that ſhall offend one of his little ones that believe in him, to have a Milſtone hanged about his Neck, and be drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> And how wittily ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be expreſt, yet he that ſhall ſay to his Brother, <hi>Thou fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell-fire,</hi> Mat. 5.22. Whatever uncharitable Reflexion therefore you have been guilty of, repent of it ſpeedily; and alſo mourn for the miſcarriages of others. When we are a little melted for our own and others faults, then we are fit for the healing mercy of God. <hi>And the Lord turned the Captivity of Job, when he prayed for his Friends,</hi> Job 42.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Learn Chriſtian Wiſdom.</hi> Thereby you will be able to weigh and conſider things, and to look at them on every ſide. What miſchief hath <hi>Zeal without Wiſdom</hi> done in the <hi>Church of God!</hi> A wiſe man will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the weight and conſequence of the things he undertakes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and defend; and then he will conſider what are the moſt proper means to convince, and to reduce his miſtaken Adverſary. <hi>He that hath knowledge, and a man of underſtanding is of an excellent</hi> (that is, a ſedate, calm, and cool) <hi>Spirit,</hi> Prov. 17.27. A wiſe Man diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between <hi>tolerable</hi> miſtakes and <hi>intolerable,</hi> and proportions his zeal and the expreſſions thereof accordingly: Whereas <hi>a fools lips enter into contention,</hi> Prov. 18.6. He is hurried by his folly into all the terms, moods and figures of Provocation. And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> calls for ſuch wiſdom upon this account, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is a wiſe man, and indued with knowledge among you? Let him come with his meekneſs of wiſdom.</hi> As the deepeſt Rivers run moſt calmly, ſo the wiſeſt minds are ever moſt peaceable. A wiſe Man will conſider that it will be in the Church, as it is in an Houſe; ſome Children <hi>do work,</hi> and others <hi>make work;</hi> ſome are for the School, ſome for the Field, ſome for the Cradle, and yet <hi>all Children;</hi> and thus <hi>God</hi> hath tempered the Body, that there may be a various love among the Members, in the ſtrong to the weak a love of <hi>Care,</hi> in the weak to the ſtrong a love of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</hi> Again, a wiſe Man can govern his paſſions, and not caſt <hi>Fire-brands, Arrows, and Death, and then ſay, Am I not in ſport?</hi> Prov. 26.19. No, he will make Controverſies as few, and then as ſhort as he can, and manage Sacred matters with a ſolid gravity. And therefore <hi>get wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>with all your getting get underſtanding:</hi> And to that end, add to earneſt <hi>Prayer,</hi> reading in <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> eſpecially; and as far as your Calling and Capacity will permit, in the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the Church; and withall <hi>Obſerve</hi> and <hi>Digeſt</hi> thoſe things which you have ſeen, or heard, or read; ſo will you be able perhaps to make peace among others, how ever to keep the peace your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Endeavour for a Catholick Spirit,</hi> that is, a due and tender reſpect to all the parts and members of the Chriſtian Church. For of that whole Myſtical Body, every true Chriſtian is a Member. For <hi>by one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit:
<pb facs="tcp:40119:41"/> —Now ye are the Body of Chriſt, and Members in particular,</hi> 1 Corinth. 12.13.27. Hereby we ſhall not ſuddenly un-Church others, at home or abroad, for ſome imperfections or corruptions; for he is but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read in the Records of the Church, that hath not obſerved manifold defects, deformities, and corruptions in all the Chriſtian Societies which have been in the World; and on the other ſide, that ſome holy Perſons in all Ages, have in ſome thing or other diſſented from the Common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and that many weak and peeviſh people have and ever will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of the reſt. On the contrary, a poor narrow ſpirit in many, hath not been the leaſt cauſe of our Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereby they have confined the <hi>Grace, Preſence,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God to ſome few Perſons or Societies, that have been more ſtrict and devout than others. No <hi>godly People</hi> but they, none <hi>godly Miniſters</hi> but theirs. And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are notoriouſly culpable in this point, while they would impropriate all <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to themſelves; not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing any perſon, how Learned and Holy ſoever, who will not be of their Communion. But a true Catholick, though he be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his own Mind of his <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> yet he can wiſh well unto, and think well of, and cordially embrace all that are ſound in the Fundamentals of Religion, though in divers things they do err and go aſtray.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Be cloathed with Humility.</hi> For whatſoever Pleas and Pretences are hung out, it is <hi>Pride</hi> within which hath an hand in the beginning and maintaining of our quarrels. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.10. <hi>Caſt out the Scorner, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhall go out: Yea, ſtrife and reproach ſhall ceaſe.</hi> Hereby we are <hi>wiſe in our own eyes,</hi> we <hi>look not on others things,</hi> but only on our own. This makes the <hi>Superiour</hi> look upon the <hi>Inferiour</hi> that differs from him with great contempt; and this prompts him that is on the <hi>lower</hi> ground to all the envious <hi>Reflections</hi> and conſtructions imaginable of him that is got <hi>above</hi> him. <hi>Sayes the one,</hi> Shall I give way or yield a jot to Men ſo ordinary for their Parts, and ſo obnoxious for their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? I that neither need them nor value them? —<hi>Sayes the other,</hi> Theſe men are all either blinded with preferment, or hunting after it; their Parts are either utterly abus'd or quite blaſted: Thus the Ball of Contention is toſs'd from one to another by the hands of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Scorn.</hi> Whereas <hi>Humility</hi> makes a Man think meanly of himſelf, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately of his own Notions and Apprehenſions, highly of thoſe that deſerve it, and reſpectfully of all. It was this which taught excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Biſhop Ridley,</hi> when he was in <hi>Priſon</hi> thus to accoſt honeſt <hi>Biſhop Hooper; However in ſome by-matters and circumſtances of Religion, your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and my ſimplicity, I grant, hath a little jarr'd —yet now,</hi> &amp;c. More comfort to them, if they had been on theſe terms in the time of their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Proſperity.</hi> Humility is a great ſtep to Unity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.2. <hi>I beſeech you, that ye walk with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forbearing one another in love: Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Pray behold how theſe <hi>Graces</hi> are here link't together, <hi>lowlineſs, meekneſs, unity and peace.</hi> The humble
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40119:41"/> man will not indure that his <hi>Reputation</hi> ſhall outweigh the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church; and therefore is more willing that <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious than <hi>Himſelf.</hi> Hee'l go two miles for one to meet his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary in an honeſt way of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> and when he cannot make his <hi>Judgment</hi> to bend, yet his <hi>Heart</hi> ſhall ſtoop to you with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. This Vertue made <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> come to <hi>Eſchines,</hi> when they were at fewd, with this greeting, <hi>Eſchines, Shall we be friends?</hi> And this dictated his anſwer, <hi>Yes, Sir, with all my heart: But remember,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> That <hi>I being elder than you, do make the firſt motion; Yea,</hi> ſaid the other, and <hi>therefore I conclude you to be the worthier man,</hi> for <hi>I began the ſtrife, and you began the peace.</hi> Let us all then be <hi>cloathed with Humility,</hi> aſſume not in regard of your Learning, Wit or Parts; conſider you are but <hi>Sharers</hi> in our Common <hi>Benefactor;</hi> neither let your Riches or Dignities make you to ſpeak or write otherwiſe than you would do without them; and this will go a great way to prevent our <hi>biting and devouring one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Apply your ſelves to the Practice of Real Piety.</hi> By this I mean, that we ſhould imploy our chief care to procure and increaſe a lively <hi>Faith,</hi> to exerciſe daily <hi>Repentance,</hi> to ſtrengthen our <hi>Hope,</hi> to inflame our <hi>Love</hi> to God, and to our Neighbour, to grow in <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Zeal, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Self-denyal:</hi> To be diligent in <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> over our Thoughts, Words and Wayes, in <hi>Mortification</hi> of our ſinfull Paſſions and Affections, in the <hi>Examination</hi> of our Spiritual Eſtate, in <hi>Meditation,</hi> in ſecret and fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> and in univerſal and ſteady <hi>Obedience.</hi> In theſe things do run the vital ſpirits of Religion: And whoſo is ſeriouſly imployed in theſe, will have but little time, and leſs mind for unneceſſary Contentions. Theſe will keep that heat about the Heart, which evaporating, degenerates into airy and fiery exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leaves the Soul as cold as Ice to any holy deſires. <hi>It is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace, not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein,</hi> Hebr. 13.9. It is manifeſt what a ſad decay of theſe hath followed our multiplied quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels; and how hard it is to be fervent in Spirit, and withall to be fiery in Controverſies. He that walks with God, and whoſe <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in Heaven,</hi> will be quickly weary of windy diſputes with men, and will be apt to conclude with one of the <hi>Ancients, Laſſus ſum, dum &amp; cum ſermone, atque invidia, &amp; cum hoſtibus, &amp; cum noſtris pugno.</hi> Which hath occaſioned divers great <hi>Divines</hi> the more earneſtly to long for Heaven, that they might be out of the noiſe of endleſs and perverſe diſputations. The ſerious Practice of Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of <hi>Divine Direction</hi> in all material points. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> Pſal. 25.14. <hi>If any man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God,</hi> John 7.17. And likewiſe, he that <hi>lives in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walks in the Spirit,</hi> dares not <hi>bite or devour</hi> his Neighbour. <hi>Let not us,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> that ſo walk, <hi>be deſirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another,</hi> Gal. 5.25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this, and in the foregoing Verſe, you have ſome Account of the deſign and end of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Incarnation and Paſſion. There were divers weighty Reaſons why he aſſum'd our Nature, and therein ſubjected himſelf to Death, and two of them are told us in this Context.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he might deſtroy the Devil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he might deliver the Elect People of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he might deſtroy the Devil, who is deſcrib'd to be one <hi>that had the power of Death;</hi> not the ſupream, but a ſubordinate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Death; a Power of Death as God's Executioner to inflict it, and affright men with it; to make it terrible and formidable to them, by heightning their guilty Fears, and repreſenting to them its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequents. In theſe, and in divers other reſpects, that might be mentioned, the Devil is ſaid to have the Power of Death. <hi>Him</hi> (as it follows) <hi>hath Chriſt deſtroyed:</hi> That is, diſarm'd and diſabled. Chriſt hath not deſtroy'd him as to his being and ſubſtance, but as to his Power and Authority over the Children and choſen of God: And this Chriſt did by his own Death; <hi>Through, or by death he deſtroy'd him that had the power of Death,</hi> viz. <hi>The Devil.</hi> It was upon the Croſs that <hi>be ſpoil'd Principalities and Powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To come to what I intend, another End and reaſon of Chriſt's
<pb facs="tcp:40119:45"/> Incarnation and Paſſion, was, that he might deliver the Elect People of God: Theſe he calls <hi>the Children,</hi> in the foregoing Verſe; not the Children of Men, as ſome expound it, but the Children of God: Such Children as the Father had given the Son, ſo they are ſaid to be <hi>Ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>I and the Children which thou haſt given me;</hi> ſuch as were <hi>predeſtinated to the adoption of Children,</hi> as it is phras'd, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. Theſe the Text alſo deſcribes, and tells us in what Condition they were by Nature; <hi>Through fear of Death they were all their life-time ſubject to bondage.</hi> By all their Life time you muſt underſtand all that time which they liv'd before they were deliver'd. This is the Condition of the Elect of God, as they come into the World, they are not only ſubject unto Death, but unto the Fear of Death, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage by reaſon thereof. The word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which is render'd ſubject, ſignifies they were held faſt, and manacled, as Birds that are taken in a ſnare, or as Malefactors that are going to their Execution. The word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which is rendred bondage, ſignifies a ſtate of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude or ſlavery, ſuch as men diſlike but cannot avoid: One calls it a poenal diſquietment or perplexity of mind, that ariſeth from a ſenſe of miſery, that a man would fain be rid of and can't; 'tis a Yoke whereby his Neck is gall'd, but he can't put it off; and if he ſhould be releaſed from it by any undue ways or means, it would be to his farther detriment and danger in the end. Now from this Fear of Death the Children are ſaid to be delivered by Chriſt. There are many evils from which he redeems and delivers them; he delivers them from the bondage of ſin and Satan, from the rigour and Curſe of the Law, from everlaſting Puniſhment and Wrath to come, and he delivers them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the Fear of Death: This is imply'd, if it be not expreſs'd in the Text; for upon the mentioning of their deliverance he gives this deſcription of the Perſons that are delivered, that they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e ſuch as were afraid of Death, and lyable to continual bondage by reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Hence all Expoſitors, both ancient and modern, do rationally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, That the Fear of Death is one of thoſe evils from whence we are deliver'd by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Text thus briefly open'd, adminiſters a fair occaſion of reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Caſe or Queſtion. <hi>From what Fear of Death are the Children of God deliver'd by Jeſus Chriſt, and by what means doth he deliver them from it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall break this Queſtion in two; and enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what Fear of Death the Children of God are delivered from by Jeſus Chriſt? And then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. By what Means or Methods he doth deliver them from it?</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what Fear of Death are the Children of God deliver'd by Jeſus Chriſt? That I may reſolve this Queſtion aright, I muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the Fear of Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a natural Fear of Death: This is common to all Men as Men, and 'tis more or leſs in them according to their different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and other accidental Occurrences. This is nothing elſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40119:45"/> but Natures averſation to it's own diſſolution, and in it's ſelf it is a ſinleſs infirmity, ſuch as ſickneſs, wearineſs, or the like. To be loth or afraid to dye, is humane and inſeparable from the nature of man; this fear of Death is found with the beſt of men. Nature (as one ſays) hath a ſhare in them as well as in others, and will work as Nature, or like it ſelf. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us how good godly men are unwilling to be <hi>uncloath'd,</hi> and to put off the body.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note> Our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour (who was a true though not a meer Man) without the leaſt impeachment of the Holineſs and Perfection of his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, expreſs'd at ſome times an averſion to death:<note place="margin">John 12.27. Mark 14.35.</note> This therefore is not the fear of Death of which the Text ſpeaks, and from which the Children of God are deliver'd by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſlaviſh Fear of Death, which hath Torment in it, or which torments the Souls of men, which fills their hearts with terrors and diſtractions, which diſcompoſeth their minds, and unfits them for the duties of their general or particular callings, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſables them from proſecuting the things that belong to their Peace and Welfare. This is that fear of Death of which the Text ſpeaks, and from which the Children are deliver'd, ſuch as genders unto bondage, and is ſervile or ſlaviſh; a fear of Death as poenal, and drawing after it everlaſting puniſhment: This fear of Death takes hold of carnal men; they are not ſo much afraid of Death, as of that which the Scripture calls <hi>the ſecond Death;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 2.11. &amp; 20.6. Heb. 9.26.</note> 'tis that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after death, that makes it ſo formidable to them; after Death (as that Text ſpeaks) comes Judgment, when they muſt receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the things which they have done in the Body. When they dye, they muſt launch out into an endleſs Ocean, and <hi>go the way</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſays) <hi>from whence they ſhall never return:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 16.22.</note> And if Death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes them in their unregenerate ſtate and condition, then it will be an entrance or inlet <hi>into outer darkneſs, where there is weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Theſe and ſuch-like are the conſiderations that make Death ſo dreadfull to the Children of Men, that give it the denomination of the King of Terrors, and of terrible things the moſt terrible; they are not (as one ſaid) afraid to dye, but they are afraid to be damn'd. Hence it is, that though Death be terrible to all men, yet it is moſt terrible to thoſe whoſe Conſciences are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and whoſe underſtandings are enlightned; who have been inſtructed in the Knowledge of God, and of a future State of Retribution. Death (as one obſerves) is not half ſo terrible to a Heathen, as it is to an ungodly Chriſtian; Heathen men are in the dark, and ſee but little of that which is the true terror of Death: But en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Chriſtians, who have been acquainted with the Scripture, who know <hi>that the Wrath of God is reveal'd from Heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18. 1 Cor. 6.9. Pſal. 9.17. 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, that the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all Nations and people that forget God; that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be reveal'd from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:46"/> know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel, who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power:</hi> That the greateſt part (by far) of the wages of ſin, which is eternal damnation, ſhall be paid in another World. Theſe are they that are ſurrounded with the ſlaviſh fears of Death.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that many wicked Perſons who live under the Goſpel, are under none of theſe terrors; but then 'tis becauſe they look on Death at a great diſtance from them, and the remoteneſs of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though in it's ſelf never ſo terrible, takes away the fear of it.</p>
            <p>Or elſe it is becauſe they are over-buſied and taken up about the things of the World, as the luſt of the fleſh, or of the eyes, or the pride of life; and if any thoughts of Death, and of the World to come ariſe in their minds, they are preſently ſmother'd and ſtifled by worldly objects and diverſions. <hi>Cain</hi> was a while afraid of Death, he thought every one that met him would ſlay him, but by and by he gets into the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> and there he falls a building of Cities, and doth ſo immerſe or drown himſelf in the affairs of the World, that by little and little the ſlaviſh fear he had of Death, did wear out of his mind.</p>
            <p>Or elſe it is becauſe of their Atheiſm or Infidelity, there is a great deal of this amongſt profeſſed Chriſtians. All wicked men (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays) are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> 
               <hi>without God in the World,</hi> or as it may be rendred, they are Atheiſts in the World: They are all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Atheiſts, and too many are Atheiſts in Opinion likewiſe; they ſay in their Hearts, though they don't ſpeak it out with their Tongues, that there is no God;<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1.</note> they have not a thorough belief of a Deity, or of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Or elſe it is, in the laſt place, becauſe of their great Security. Multitudes of profeſſed Chriſtians are faſt aſleep in their ſins; they give up themſelves ſinfully, and many of them are given up of God judicially, to a ſpirit of ſlumber and of deep ſleep: And when this is the caſe with men, no wonder they are without any dread of Death, or Hell, or any thing elſe. You know when a Man is in a deep ſleep, he fears no danger whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch-like are the reaſons, why many carnal perſons do ſpend their days in mirth and ſenſuality, without any actual fear of Death, or of it's dreadfull conſequents: But then it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that theſe very perſons are <hi>ſubject</hi> or liable thereunto; and if God awaken their Conſciences, and rouze them out of their ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Job 24.17. Pſal. 55.4, 5.</note> then they are (as 'tis in <hi>Job) in the terrors of the ſhadow of death; horror overwhelmes them,</hi> (as 'tis in that Pſalm) <hi>and the terrors of death fall upon them:</hi> Like <hi>Foelix,</hi> they fall a <hi>trembling,</hi> and like <hi>Belſhazzar their knees are ready to ſmite one againſt another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis time now, that I ſhould come to the ſecond branch of the Queſtion, which is,</p>
            <p>By what Means and Methods are the Children of God deliver'd by Chriſt from the fear of Death?</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40119:46"/>
            <p>To this I ſhall return an Anſwer: Firſt, By ſhewing you what Chriſt hath already done; and then, Secondly, What he continues ſtill to do in order to this end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew you, what Chriſt hath already done to deliver or free the Children of God from the fear of Death: He himſelf in his own Perſon <hi>hath ſuffered or taſted death for them.</hi> This is every where declar'd in the New Teſtament, and 'tis hinted to us in the Text. Chriſt <hi>by death,</hi> that is, by his own death, <hi>hath delivered the Children from the fear of death.</hi> The death of Chriſt hath made Death to look with another face than formerly it had: As the Wood that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> caſt into the waters of <hi>Marah</hi> did alter their property, ſo the Death of Chriſt hath alter'd the property of Death, and taken away the bitterneſs and formidableneſs thereof; hence 'tis that the death of Believers in Scripture is call'd a Sleep: It is ſaid of <hi>Stephen</hi> when he dyed, (though it was by a violent death) <hi>That he fell aſleep:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 7.60.</note> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. That as <hi>Jeſus dyed and roſe again, even ſo them that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi> It is well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, that the Apoſtle doth ſeem purpoſely to vary the Phraſe, he ſays, that Jeſus <hi>dyed,</hi> and that the Saints <hi>ſleep</hi> in Him; and the reaſon is, becauſe that he ſuſtained Death with all its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that ſo it might become a calm and quiet ſleep unto the Saints. The Death of Chriſt muſt needs ſweeten the fore-thoughts of death to the Children and Choſen of God, becauſe that he dy'd in their ſtead; he did not only dye in their Nature, but in their Room; not only for rheir good, but alſo in their ſtead. You know how it was with the Sacrifices of old, they were put to death in the room of the Sacrificers: So it was with Chriſt, the truth of thoſe Sacrifices, he was put to death in the room of Sinners, and they dy'd in him as their Repreſentative. Now this ſerves to free them from an enthralling fear of Death; why ſhould they fear that, which Chriſt hath undergone in their place and room.</p>
            <p>There are two things more to be conſidered under this Head.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Chriſt by his Death hath taken away the true Reaſon of the fear of Death, that is, the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law of God. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, That <hi>the ſting of death is ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note> 
               <hi>and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law:</hi> Death hath it's wounding power from ſin, and ſin hath it's condemning power from the Law; 'tis the Law that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the nature of ſin, that enhanceth the guilt of ſin, that denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth condemnation againſt him that commits it; and 'tis this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law that torments the Sinner with the fear of death. Now Chriſt having in our ſtead ſubjected himſelf to death, and ſo undergone the penalty of the Law, he hath taken away the Curſe and condemning power thereof. He hath, ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curſe of the Law, being himſelf made a Curſe for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> The death of Chriſt hath ſatisfi'd every demand of the broken Law: The Law of God hath nothing now to lay to the charge of God's Elect, it owns
<pb facs="tcp:40119:47"/> the Blood of Chriſt to be a ſufficient compenſation for their violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it; there are no petty ſatisfactions to be made by themſelves, ſince Chriſt hath made compleat ſatisfaction for them, and in their behalf. The Law now is ready to acquit the Believer, it ſays, Thou mayſt live for all me, and live eternally; I require not thy death as being ſatisfied with the Death of Chriſt: When thou dyeſt a natural death, it is rather to comply with the appointment of God, and in order to the raiſing up hereafter, a better and more curious Fabrick of thy Body, than to ſatisfie any demand of mine.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Chriſt by his Death hath deprived the Devil of the power of death; and by this means alſo he hath deliver'd the Children from a ſervile fear of Death. The Devil (as I ſaid before) hath a power to terrifie the Conſciences of men, with the apprehenſion of death, and the dreadful conſequents thereof; you ſee into what bondage he brings men upon this account, many times he brings the Children themſelves into the ſuburbs of Hell, and lays them under dreadful ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and horrors; the <hi>pains of Hell,</hi> ſays one of them, <hi>gat hold of me, I found trouble and ſorrow;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.3. 2 Sam. 22.6.</note> and again at another time, the <hi>ſorrows of death compaſſed me about:</hi> Now this power of Satan is taken away by the Death of Chriſt. The Blood of Chriſt hath cancel'd, or at leaſt contracted and leſſened his Commiſſion: So that when he aſſaults a Believer in this kind, he is eaſily reſiſted; the Devil gives ground if the Believer ſtands his ground; he can't prevail againſt a Child of God, unleſs God give him a ſpecial Commiſſion, or unleſs he yields to his Temptation; being juſtified by Faith in the Death of Chriſt, we have that peace which all the Devils in Hell are not able to diſturb; the weapons of his power, and warfare in this way, are wreſted out of his hands by the Death of Chriſt. Thus you ſee what Chriſt hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let me proceed to ſhew you what he continues ſtill to do, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the freeing and delivering the Children of God from the fear of death, and the bondage that enſues thereon.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He worketh and increaſeth thoſe Graces of his Spirit in them which are deſtructive hereof, and oppoſite hereunto: you'l ſay, which are they?</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the Grace of Faith: This is the Grace that conquers the World, that conquers the Devil, and that conquers alſo the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear of Death. This excellent Grace of Faith hath ſuch an excellent hand in the conquering of all theſe, that it is call'd the conqueſt and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory it's ſelf; <hi>This is the victory,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi>) 1 John 5.4. <hi>even your Faith:</hi> Our Saviour tells <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.31, 32. <hi>That Satan had deſired to have him, that he might ſift him as Wheat.</hi> And with what did he ſift and ſhake him? Why, it was with the fear of Death; he was afraid they would deal with him, as they did with his Maſter: It was his ſlaviſh fear of Death that made him deny Chriſt, and to do it once and again; but anon he recovered himſelf, and got above this fear, he was re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy by and by boldly to confeſs Chriſt, and that in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40119:47"/> the face of Death and danger. How came this about? Why it was by means of Faith: Chriſt had pray'd for him that his Faith ſhould not fail; it may be ſaid of thoſe that are fearful of death, that they are of little Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Grace is Love: An ardent love of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will baniſh all ſlaviſh fear of death out of the Soul, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.18. <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear.</hi> Of what fear doth he ſpeak? The next words tell you, he ſpeaks of ſlaviſh tormenting fear, of that fear <hi>which hath torment:</hi> By perfect love, he means a greater meaſure and degree of love. I ſaid but now of fearfull Chriſtians, that they have but little Faith, I may add alſo, that they have but little Love, for perfect or great love expells all tormenting and ſervile fear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Grace is Hope: The very nature of Hope is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to fear. Where there is a Hope of eternal life, there can be no prevailing fear of Death. 'Tis ſaid <hi>of the righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14.32.</note> 
               <hi>that they have Hope in their death,</hi> and thoſe that have Hope in their death, they are not afraid to dye. Then Hope doth more eſpecially free us from an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate fear of Death, when it grows up to that which the Scripture calls <hi>The full aſſurance of Faith:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6.11.</note> this is a gracious Gift which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſtows upon many of his Children; they know <hi>that they are in him, that they are paſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> from death to life;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2.5.3.14. 2 Cor. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>that when the earthly houſe of this tabernacle is diſſolv'd, they ſhall have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Ay, this is that which ſteels and fortifies them againſt the fear and terror of Death. This leads me to conſider of a ſecond way or means whereby Chriſt delivers the Children from a ſlaviſh fear of death.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He delivers them from it by convincing and parſwading them that they ſhall not be Loſers, but Gainers, yea, great gainers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. It was this perſwaſion that made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to deſire death, rather than to dread it; <hi>I deſire</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to depart,</hi> or to be diſſolv'd, <hi>which is far better,</hi> Philip. 1.23. And again, <hi>v.</hi> 21. he ſaith, <hi>For me to dye is gain.</hi> It were eaſie here to expatiate, and ſhew the advantage, the exceeding great advantage that Believers have by Death: It is commonly ſaid to conſiſt in theſe two things, in a freedom from all Evil, in the fruition of all Good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It conſiſts in a freedom from all Evil, which is ſub-divided into the evil of Sorrow, and the evil of Sin. Believers are freed by Death from the evil of Sorrow. 'Tis one bleſſed Notion of the life to come, that God <hi>will wipe off all tears from his peoples eyes,</hi> and remove all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and cauſes of Sorrow from their Hearts. Believers alſo are freed by Death from the evil of ſin, which is indeed the greateſt evil, the evil of evils, all the evils of ſorrow are but the effects and fruits of the evil of ſin. By Death they are deliver'd from all actual ſins, not only from Fleſhly but Spiritual filthineſs: Now they are deliver'd ordinarily from inordinate actions, but then alſo from inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; they ſhall never any more be troubled with Pride, Paſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:48"/> Diſcontent, Unbelief, or the like. By Death alſo they are diſcharg'd from Original ſin, and all remainders thereof; when the Body dies, Believers are rid of that body of death which dwelleth in them, and is always preſent with them; they no more complain of themſelves as wretched creatures upon the account thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It conſiſts in the fruition of all Good. Believers when they dye they enjoy God Himſelf, who is the chiefeſt Good; He is <hi>bonum in quae omnia bona;</hi> all other things that are good and deſireable are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in him, as the Sun-beams are in the Sun: the Saints enjoyment of God in this life, is a Heaven upon Earth, but our enjoyment of God after death will be the Heaven of Heavens. <hi>David</hi> ſays in one Place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> 
               <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> There are Saints and Angels and Arch-Angels in Heaven, (ſays <hi>Muſculus,</hi>) with whom <hi>David</hi> and ſuch as he will have to do; but what are theſe to God? Believers won't barely enjoy God after death, but they will enjoy him fully. In this life they enjoy a little of God; and oh how ſweet and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is! But in the life to come they ſhall have as much enjoyment of God as their hearts can wiſh, or hold: Now they enjoy God in the uſe of means, in Prayer, in hearing the Word, and in receiving the Lords Supper; but hereafter they ſhall have not only a full, but an immediate fruition of God: Now they ſee the Face of God in the Glaſs of his Word and Ordinances, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> what a lovely ſight is it! But then they ſhall ſee God face to face, and what tongue can men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or heart imagine the lovelineſs of that ſight?</p>
            <p>If it were not too great a digreſſion, I could readily demonſtrate the gain and advantage of Death from other Topicks. Believers in the other life, ſhall poſſeſs and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, which doth more tranſcend the Kingdoms of this World, and all the glory of them, than the light of the Sun doth excell the light of a Candle; they ſhall be moſt gloriouſly perfected both in their Souls, and in their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; their vile bodies at the Reſurrection, <hi>ſhall be changed and faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like unto the glorious body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> Their gain and happineſs will be greatly augmented in the other life, by the work and employment that they ſhall do, and by the Society and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they ſhall have; they ſhall aſſociate with an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, and with juſt men made perfect; with many of their deareſt Relations and Friends, whom whilſt alive they dearly lov'd, and whoſe death and departure hence they greatly lamented. Let me cloſe this with one Text, 'tis in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. There the Apoſtle tells, us wherein the gain and glory of the godly conſiſteth after death, he ſumms it up in two things, <hi>They ſhall be like Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Ay, that is the happineſs of the Children when they dye, it lyes in Conformity to Chriſt, and in the Viſion, the beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt delivers Believers from the ſlaviſh fear of Death, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome real Foretaſtes of Heaven, and of Eternal Life: It is uſual with God to give his People ſome Cluſter of the Grapes of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40119:48"/> here in the Wilderneſs; to give them ſome drops and ſips of that new Wine, which they ſhall drink full draughts of in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their Father; he gives them to taſte not only of <hi>the good Word of God, and of the heavenly gift, but of the powers of the world to come;</hi> and this ſets them a longing to have their fill thereof: Even as the <hi>Gauls</hi> when they had taſted the Wines of <hi>Italy,</hi> they were not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd to have thoſe Wines brought to them, but they would go and poſſeſs the Land where they grew. This foretaſte of Heaven is that which the Scripture calls <hi>The earneſt of our Inheritance;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1.14.</note> 'tis both a pledge and a ſmall part of that Happineſs which the Saints ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after inherit:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note> 
               <hi>We</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>that have the firſt-fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even we our ſelves, do groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, the redemption of our body:</hi> By Redemption he means the Reſurrection of the Body at the laſt day, which the Scripture calls a <hi>Reſurrection unto Life.</hi> The Apoſtle knew there could be no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body without the diſſolution thereof; therefore in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the one, he muſt needs alſo wait for the other. The Apoſtle and the Believers with him did groan for this; they were ſo far from groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the fears of Death, that they rather groan'd to be partakers of that which follows after Death, nay, <hi>In this they groan'd earneſtly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.2.</note> as he elſewhere ſpeaks: Now whence was this, but from their having the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, which are all one with the foretaſtes of Heaven and everlaſting Happineſs, of which I have been ſpeaking. Thoſe that whilſt they live have theſe taſtes of future Bleſſedneſs, they are not afraid of Death, the door by which they enter into the full enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p>Having thus reſolved this Queſtion in both its Branches, give me leave to make ſome ſhort Application of what I have ſaid, and I'le conclude.</p>
            <p>I would Exhort you that are the Children of God; (and Oh that all that read theſe Lines were of the number of ſuch) I would earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech and exhort you to prize and improve this great Priviledge, to wit, a deliverance from the ſlaviſh Fear of Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be perſwaded to Prize it; it is a Priviledge that was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd for you at a dear rate, even with the precious Blood of Chriſt. Oh what a bleſſed Priviledge is this, not only to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the ſecond Death, but alſo from the ſervile and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralling fear of the firſt Death! This is the benefit and bleſſing that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to be ſo much affected with: <hi>Thanks be to God</hi> (ſays he) <hi>who hath given us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> What Victory doth he mean? The foregoing words tell us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that he means a Victory over Death, with all its fearful concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and conſequents. Death is become a Friend, and not an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; 'tis without any Sting or Curſe attending of it: Oh! this is owing to Jeſus Chriſt, he is the great Deliverer; he hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the matter, that though we muſt dye, yet we ſhall not be
<pb facs="tcp:40119:49"/> in bondage all our dayes, through a ſlaviſh Fear of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be perſwaded to Improve this Priviledge; put in for a part and ſhare therein. See to it, that you be Partakers of this benefit of Chriſt's Death, to live without any tormenting fear of your own. You'l ſay, how ſhall we help it? can we contribute any thing towards our Deliverance from the Fear of Death? I anſwer, You may: And therefore as I have ſhewn you what Chriſt hath done, and doth to deliver you; ſo now give me leave to ſhew you farther what you muſt do towards your own Deliverance. I'le give you ſome ſhort hints of things, which you may enlarge upon at your leiſure in your own thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You muſt be earneſt with God that he would apply to you this benefit of his Sons Death, by his bleſſed Spirit. Oh! begg of God, and that with all importunity, that the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus may ſet you free from a tormenting Fear of Death: This hath been done for others, and who can tell but it may be done for you likewiſe;<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.37.</note> only remember <hi>that God will be enquir'd of by you, to do this for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You muſt give all diligence to the attaining of a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Faith, Love, and Hope; yea, to the attaining of a full Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Hope; 'tis by means hereof (as you heard before) that the Children are deliver'd in part from the Fear of Death. 'Tis Grace, and the Aſſurance of Grace that is the Anchor of the Soul, that keeps it ſafe from the fear of Shipwrack.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You muſt reſiſt the Devil, and withſtand his Temptations, not only to other ſins, but to the ſin of Deſpondency in particular: You muſt not give place to Satan, nor give way to enthralling Fear, when he tempts you thereunto. Remember, (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) 'tis the Law of the Combate betwixt the Devil and you, that if you fight, he ſhall fly; if you ſtand your ground, he muſt give ground.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You muſt have frequent Meditation of Death, and of the gain that is to be gotten thereby; the frequent thoughts hereof will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarize Death to you, and if once Death and you be familiar toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you won't be ſo much afraid of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You muſt have frequent Contemplation alſo of the Reſurrection. You find that <hi>Job</hi> had conquer'd the Fear of Death, and if you read the 9th. Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Ver.</hi> 26, 27. you will ſee that his thoughts of the Reſurrection were very helpful to him herein. He is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror over the Fear of Death, that conſiders with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that the <hi>Grave ſhall loſe its Victory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note> It was the ſaying of a worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of our Nation, That nothing lifted him over the Fear of Death, like the belief and Meditation of the Reſurrection to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="6">6. You muſt take heed of living or allowing your ſelves in any known Sin; if it be <hi>as your right eye, you muſt pull it out.</hi> The guilt of one known ſin will put a ſting into Death, and make it very terrible to you, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in your near approaches unto it.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40119:49"/>7. You muſt look to it, that your whole <hi>Converſation be order'd arigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>for the the end of that man is peace.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was above the Fear of Death, he ſeem'd rather to deſire than dread it, (as I ſaid before) and well it might be thus with him, ſeeing he <hi>liv'd in all good Conſcience;</hi> and had this Teſtimony from his Conſcience, <hi>That in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity,</hi>

            <p>To ſuch the Apoſtle accommodates theſe words: <hi>Nevertheleſs,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Granting all that any fearfull and weak (but true) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers amongſt you can Object, that ſo many fall away, and ſuch as ſeem'd ſo reſolute, have Apoſtatiz'd,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.24.25.</note>

As the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding us to have any other God, commands us to take <hi>Jehovah</hi> for our God, and to Love and Obey him accordingly. And thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Iniquity includes not only the leaving of all Sin, but the following after, and practiſing of Holineſs in all Duties that are required, in every Relation and Condition: So that there is no Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God or Man, but he that names the Name of Chriſt is required to practiſe it; nor no Sin againſt God or Man, againſt the firſt or

            <p>As to the firſt, What is meant by naming the Name of Chriſt?<note place="margin">What is meant by naming the name of Chriſt.</note> it is evident, that it cannot be underſtood of a bare ſpeaking of the word Chriſt, ſounding the letters of which it is made, which <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> may do, and the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> often did; but by naming the Name of Chriſt, is underſtood, a making ſome ſpecial uſe of it, or of him that is ſignified by it: We muſt therefore conſider,</p>
            <p>That whereſoever there is any thing of Divine Revelation, there mans Fall and Miſery is manifeſted: for tho by natural Light it could be perceiv'd that all was not well with Man; hence the many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that Nature dealt very hardly with <hi>Man,</hi> the nobleſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature, that had rule and command over the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet that he was ſo ſhort-lived, ſo full of miſery and trouble,<note place="margin">Job 5.7.</note> which ſeem'd as natural to him, as for ſparks to flie upward: This was for a lamentation amongſt the very Heathen: But <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In the Word of God we have Means preſcribed, Inſtitutions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, which being uſed, and obſerved, will help and recover us.</p>
            <p>In the former Oeconomy and Diſpenſation, they were vail'd under Shadows and Types. The wages of Sin being Death,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17. Rom. 6.23.</note> every Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the Law forfeits his Life, and his ſin cannot be expiated but by Blood, it might juſtly have been his own blood, and no others: But the Law-giver being graciouſly pleas'd to accept of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam vicariam,</hi> anothers blood or life, ſuch as he ſhould appoint; he did for a while accept of the ſacrificing of Beaſts in the ſtead of the Sinners, till the fulneſs of time was come, in which he ſent his Son (this Chriſt whom the Text mentions) to make full ſatisfaction to his offended Juſtice, and by his Death to expiate for all the ſins of them that by Faith apply themſelves unto him. Hence it is ſaid, he <hi>was made ſin for us,</hi> and that <hi>he was bruiſed for our Iniquities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21. Iſa. 53.5.</note> and that the <hi>chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as under the Law the Tranſgreſſor was to lay his hand upon the Beaſt to be ſacrific'd, thereby acknowledging that he was the Creature that had deſerv'd to dye, and deſiring that the death of the Beaſt to be ſacrificed might be accepted in his ſtead;<note place="margin">Lev. 3.2.4.4.</note> ſo under the Goſpel we muſt apply to Chriſt with a due ſenſe of our ſins, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of death for them, and be accordingly affected with them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:52"/>
            <p>Yet more, when all the outward Ceremonies were perform'd, the ſacrific'd Beaſt accepted and ſlain, thô the Law according to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſatisfied, and a legal Expiation did enſue, and a legal Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made; yet if the Perſon that brought the Sacrifice did not mortifie his ſin, as well as the Prieſt kill the Sacrifice, his Conſcience inwardly remained defiled, and God ſtill provoked and incenſed: Nay, if the Sinner had done one without the other, killed his Beaſt, and ſpared his ſin alive, God look'd upon it as a double Iniquity, for ſo indeed it was; to acknowledge he had offended God, and to pretend that he deſired to be reconciled unto him, and yet to go on in provoking of him. Hence God did forbid and reject their Sacrifices, tho of his own appointment;<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.9.</note> I will take no <hi>Bullock out of thy houſe, nor he-goats out of thy fold:</hi> Nay, he declares that in ſuch a caſe, <hi>he that killeth an Oxe,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>incenſe is an abomination unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that all Sacrifices were Types of Chriſt, thrô whom only they had their virtue and efficacy, is confeſſed by all Chriſtians: Thus <hi>Chriſt was a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> And the Chriſtian when affected with his ſin, and deſirous to be reconciled to God, whom by his ſin he hath provok'd, layes the hand of his Faith upon Chriſt, and humbly beggs that Chriſt's Death for him may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inſtead of his own, which he had deſerved. But now (to give a further illuſtration of my Text and Subject) if he pleads (thô for Chriſt's ſake) for pardon of ſin, and yet retains a love and liking to his ſin; if he deſires never ſo earneſtly that he may not dye for ſin, and yet is willing that his ſin may live, theſe are vain Oblations, vain Prayers, but moſt real and dreadfull provocations.

            <p>Now we muſt ſuppoſe that the convinced Sinner ſets himſelf as in God's ſight, and having ſeriouſly conſidered what the Law threatens, dreading that Curſe and Wrath to come; hearing his Conſcience pleading guilty to the Accuſations of the Law againſt him, he ſeems to hear the Judge asking of him what he hath to ſay for himſelf, why the ſentence of death ſhould not paſs upon him; here it is that he <hi>names Chriſt,</hi> and remembers in Prayer unto God, what the Bleſſed Jeſus did and ſuffered unto the utmoſt for him, he <hi>became ſin for</hi> him; he could not be a Sinner, but he was dealt withall as if he had been one, becauſe he was in the Sinners ſtead: Now the convinc'd Sinner urges God's Promiſe and Covenant with Chriſt, that <hi>He ſhould ſee of the travel of his Soul,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="1">1. That departing from Iniquity (or Holineſs) is no Cauſe of our Juſtification, properly taken; notwithſtanding,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Holineſs hath an Influence upon our <hi>Salvation;</hi> and alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Holineſs is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to all juſtified Perſons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay more, Free Juſtification, or Juſtification by God's Free Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, is the beſt, and moſt forcible Incentive unto Holineſs.<note place="margin">Departing from Iniquity is no cauſe of Juſtification.</note>
            </p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> (1.) It will appear that Holineſs is no Cauſe of our Juſtification: It did neither move God when foreſeen to chooſe us, or when actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſting to juſtifie us.<note place="margin">Mercy is only from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in God.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For all God's Works of Mercy ariſe from ſomething in God himſelf, who is the fountain of Mercy, or of living waters; and Judgments are ſaid to be his <hi>ſtrange Work,</hi> becauſe he never proceeds to them but when he is neceſſitated to vindicate the Glory of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Attributes; that is,<note place="margin">Jer. 17.13.</note> the cauſe of all God's ſeverities is out of himſelf, and only to be found in the provocations of his Creatures. The Cauſe of all his Mercies are his own Bowels and Compaſſions, and wholly in and from himſelf: <hi>O Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.9.</note> 
               <hi>thy deſtruction is from thy ſelf,</hi> but <hi>in me is thy help:</hi> Nay, when God ſays unto the Soul, <hi>Live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.6.</note> he <hi>ſees it in its Blood;</hi> and it remains <hi>in its Blood,</hi> untill he ſays unto it, <hi>Live:</hi> for in the Apoſtles Phraſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.5, 6.</note> he juſtifies <hi>the ungodly and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> that is, God does for Chriſt's ſake diſcharge and acquit Sinners who flee unto him, and deſire Pardon and Acceptance thro the Blood of his Son, <hi>The Lamb of God that thus taketh away the ſin of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet thus the Judge of all the Earth does right too, when he makes Chriſt to become Righteouſneſs unto the believing and penitent Sinners; for by the ſame Reaſon and Juſtice that <hi>they fell in one Adam,</hi> they may be <hi>made alive in another,</hi> and <hi>where is the Diſputer?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>God gets nothing by all our holieſt Performances, devouteſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Job. 22.2.</note> and moſt ſpiritual Duties: Our <hi>righeouſneſs cannot profit him.</hi> Can a Man <hi>be profitable unto God?</hi> that is, he cannot by any ways be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto his Maker: no, 'tis for our ſakes that God hath given us his Commandments and Inſtitutions, that we might by them mend the frame and temper of our hearts, and be fitted for to enjoy him to all Eternity; in the mean while to ſtay our longing after him, he affords us to ſee him thus, tho as in a glaſs darkly.</p>
            <p>But if God could be promerited (as they ſpeak) and obliged, it muſt be by ſome things that are our own; and Secondly, It muſt be by ſuch things as are not due upon any other account whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7</note> Now what <hi>haſt thou which thou haſt not received?</hi> Thy Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers, thy Grace and Goodneſs, a Heart and Will to do good, every Enlargement of Prayer, and Exerciſe of Faith, or any other Grace, is his; it is he that works in us <hi>to will and to do</hi> accord-to his own good pleaſure;<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.

Where is there any proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe, and any returns we can make? In all Trading or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing, there 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>quid</hi> for <hi>quo,</hi> which cannot be given to God by us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Departing from Iniquity hath an Influence upon our Salvation, tho it be not a Cauſe of our Salvation:<note place="margin">Departing from Iniquity hath its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon (tho no cauſe of) our ſalvation.</note> And tho it cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a foregoing condition of our Juſtification, for the Reaſons above given; yet it muſt be acknowledged to be a condition in the Heirs of Salvation, for without holineſs no Man ſhall ſee God: And rightly underſtood, Holineſs is ſuch a thing with which we ſhall be ſaved,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> and to be ſure without which we ſhall not be ſaved. The Heathens made the way to the Temple of Honour thro the Temple of Virtue: And amongſt Chriſtians, Grace is the way to Glory; that is, walking in the way of God's Commandments, brings us to the place where God is, which way is as neceſſary to be walk'd in by all thoſe that will go to God at laſt, as a path that leads to a Town or place muſt be gone in, by all that will come thither.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, good Works do not go before Juſtification, but follow after; for being ſanctified alſo when we are juſtified, we are <hi>created un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good works in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.10.</note> Till we have a Being we cannot act, and till the Root be made good, the Fruit cannot be good. Amongſt the Moraliſts it may ſtill be a Rule, <hi>Bona agendo, ſumus boni;</hi> By doing good we become good; but this muſt not be ſo ſtrictly urged in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, where the Fountain muſt be cleanſed before the Stream can run pure: indeed after Converſion and Regeneration, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the habits of Grace more than the actings of Grace; and in this, natural and infuſed Habits do agree; they are both ſtrengthned
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40119:54"/> by acting of them. Whatſoever Grace you would have ſtrong and lively in the Soul; let it be conſcienciouſly and frequently exerciſed, and it will become ſo: This hath many a <hi>probatum eſt</hi> amongſt the Children of God.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe things do give us a true account, why in Scripture we ſhall find good Works and Holineſs ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified on the one hand, and yet ſometimes on the other hand ſo debaſed: Not to make proof of the former, (the extolling good works, which deſervedly is every where in Scripture:) Yet withall we ſhall find them very diminutively ſpoken of in Scripture; as where it is ſaid, That <hi>Our righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags;</hi> and alſo where the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.6.</note> That he accounts his <hi>blameleſneſs and righteouſneſs</hi> which is in the <hi>Law, but loſs, nay dung.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to ſay, when good Works are conſidered with any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Juſtification, or when they are compared with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, we cannot think or ſpeak too meanly of them: But when Holineſs is conſidered as a Fruit of the Spirit, always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying Juſtification, and a requiſite preparative for Glory, and an Ornament to our Profeſſion; in the mean while we cannot too much extoll it, nor be too zealous and earneſt in the acquiring and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing of it; eſpecially conſidering that</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Holineſs is indiſpenſibly neceſſary unto all juſtified Perſons.<note place="margin">Holineſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably ceſſary to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified Ones.</note> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Iniquity is the Duty of all that name the Name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould take upon him our Fleſh; ſo it is as neceſſary that we ſhould receive from him his Spirit; he muſt become <hi>Fleſh of our fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Bone of our bone,</hi> that he might pay our debt in the ſame nature which contracted it; ſo we muſt partake of his Spirit, that we may be capacitated to receive the Fruit of his Redemption, and be one with him.</p>
            <p>Nay all Promiſes, the very Covenant of Grace its ſelf is thus to be underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Beneficiaries, or they that receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them, ſhould be holy, otherwiſe they might not, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, hope for any good from them: And tho we do not meet with this always expreſs'd; yet it is alwayes to be underſtood,<note place="margin">Jer. 22.24.</note> God expreſly declaring, that tho <hi>Coniah</hi> a wicked Perſon, was as a Signet upon his right hand, yet he would pluck him thence.</p>
            <p>And when God engageth to continue his Favour unto any, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth to continue them in a fit diſpoſition to receive his Favour. Thus to the Poſterity of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.32.</note> which in a Type were the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the ſpiritual Seed that ſhould be raiſed to our Elder Brother-Chriſt Jeſus, whom <hi>David</hi> typified, it was promiſed that they ſhould endure for ever; but then in caſe of forſaking of God's Law, he would viſit their <hi>Tranſgreſſions with a Rod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 29.</note> or he would uſe ſuch means (tho irkſome for him to do, and grievous for them to bear,) as might bring them back unto himſelf by Repentance. Nay were the Promiſe of God never ſo plain and full in any caſe unto
<pb facs="tcp:40119:55"/> any Perſon, yet there is always a <hi>Subintelligitur</hi> of ſuch a demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as may be fit to receive the mercy promiſed, as we may ſee in the caſe of <hi>Eli</hi> and his Family, which God doth acknowledge that he had promiſed the Prieſthood to; and yet upon the provocations of <hi>Eli</hi> and his Sons,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.30.</note> God ſays, <hi>Be it far from me,</hi> that I ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: Neither is God unrighteous, or his Veracity to be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt, for ſo long as we have to do with ſo Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a God, all Covenants are to be underſtood ſo, as may agree with his Holineſs, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, But <hi>they are but vain words,</hi> that thou haſt ſuch Mercies promiſed unto thee, and treaſured up for thee, whereas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou beeſt ſanctified and <hi>born again, thou canſt not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3.3.</note> or ſo much <hi>as ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> or be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by any promiſe that God hath made: As 'tis ſtoryed of one who was very debauched and wicked, and taking up a Bible, which by his Religion he had not been acquainted with, (being a Papiſt) he confeſſed that whatſoever Book that was, it made againſt him: So unleſs thou doſt ſincerely labour after holineſs, there is never a word in all the Book of God that ſpeaks any comfort unto thee, none of the Fruit that grows upon the Tree of Life can be taſted by thee.</p>
            <p>This might be more evinc'd, if we fix our mind on theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> From the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God.</note>1. The firſt may be taken from the Nature of God, I mean the Eſſential Holineſs of this Nature, by which he cannot have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any one that is unholy, no more than Light can have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Darkneſs; but he indiſpenſibly hates and oppoſes all wickedneſs, and hath declared his Enmity againſt it. As fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but devour ſtubble,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.24.</note> ſo God's Holineſs will not ſuffer him to ſpare any whom he finds ſin and guilt upon: hence ſo many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and denunciations of Judgments againſt it, which do not lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whatſoever the Sinner may think; neither can the Goſpel change God's Nature, or make him leſs to abhorr ſin. It is indeed a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the way and means which God hath ordained to exalt his Grace and Mercy to the Sinner by, but it is in ſaving of him from his ſin, and not with it. Nay,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> From the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites in the Goſpel its ſelf.</note>2. All the Priviledges of the Goſpel do include, or preſuppoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Iniquity. An unholy Perſon, whilſt ſuch, <hi>Ipſa ſalus non poteſt ſalvare;</hi> Salvation its ſelf cannot preſerve. How did the <hi>Jews</hi> ſearch every hole and corner of their houſes to find out leaven, and how earneſtly did they caſt it away, or elſe the Paſchal Lamb would not have availed them, and the deſtroying Angel would not have paſs'd from them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.6.</note> And theſe things are our Examples, and tell us, that unleſs we induſtriouſly ſearch out and caſt away the leaven of ſin and wickedneſs, the very Death of Chriſt, the Lamb of God, will profit us nothing. 'Tis as the firſt Principle of the Chriſtian Religion, that the Unrighteous <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40119:55"/> which the Apoſtle took for granted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could not but know.<note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> And what a Bead-roll is there of ſuch as he declares ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God! No leſs than ten abominations are there mentioned to exclude from Heaven, and ſome of them valued in common account but as Peccadillo's. Men are apt to ſay of any ſin, Is it not a little one, <hi>and my Soul ſhall live?</hi> But as the Apoſtle there cautions, <hi>Be not deceived;</hi> deceits of this nature are frequent, but very dangerous. And this is the Goſpel to which we appeal, when we are ſcared and frighted by the Law: But in all the Goſpel there is nothing that can take away, or leſſen our Obligation to God's Commandments; but what does every way ſtraighten and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it: Now we are bound with a double Cord, which is harder to be broken, and it ſhews that ſin under the Goſpel hath acquired great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtrength when it ſnaps it aſunder.</p>
            <p>Let us take a view of the Priviledges of thoſe that are ſaved by the Goſpel, and ſee how they are obliged to Holineſs by them.<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Election</hi> is the firſt, and if we <hi>are choſen in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>We are choſen in him, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> and if we ſhould make our <hi>Calling and Election ſure,</hi> it muſt be <hi>with fear and trembling.</hi> The <hi>Book of Life</hi> is with God in Heaven; thou canſt not ſee thy Name there, but it is tranſcribed for thy comfort in thy Heart when thou art ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the more thou proceedeſt in Holineſs, the more legible it will be unto thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Vocation</hi> is unto Holineſs. Does God call any of his to come from the World and Sin unto him? As Chriſt called <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>His Sheep do hear his voice,</hi> they are called <hi>to be Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.7.</note> they are called to be made holy, and to be ſanctified; whatſoever they were before, when once they come to Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> 
               <hi>but</hi> ye are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>but</hi> ye are ſanctified: Chriſt comes by Water and Blood, and not by Water or Blood only; and Chriſt is made of God unto us not only Righteouſneſs, but <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our <hi>Regeneration</hi> or <hi>being Born again,</hi> which the Goſpel inſiſts ſo much upon, is in being made <hi>like unto God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> enabled to love what he loves, and to hate what he hates, and to be conformed unto him in all things: So that God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Ones have but <hi>one Will:</hi> Thus they are ſaid to be <hi>created again unto good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And what is <hi>Glory</hi> which we ſeek for, and endeavour after,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.7.</note> but only <hi>Holineſs in perfection?</hi> Grace is Glory in the Bud, Glory is Grace in the Flower; hence they are put together, and we are ſaid to be called <hi>to Glory and Vertue.</hi> Whereſoever true Grace is,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.3.</note> there will be Glory; and in whomſoever Glory is, there hath been Grace. God hath put theſe two together, and let no Man put them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: As <hi>Laban</hi>'s two Daughters were diſpoſed of; the Elder, thô leſs lovely, muſt be firſt accepted by <hi>Jacob;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 29.26.</note> ſo God deals with his two, Grace and Glory: Grace is the elder, and thô not ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:56"/> every one would covet Glory: yet this is the Law of the Land, the Younger muſt not be given before the Elder, you muſt woo for, and obtain Grace, before you can be admitted to the enjoyment of <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, we are only ſo far Chriſtians as we are like Chriſt in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Practice, as we partake of the Spirit which he had, and lead ſuch a Life as he did. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is not an empty name, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called ſo, makes us not to be ſo. Every one is not a Scholar, or an Artiſt in any faculty, who is called ſo: Beſides, Chriſtianity is a practical Science, and thou haſt no more of it than thou doſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. (Oh how little have moſt men!) The Heathen painted their Deified Heroes with this ſentence proceeding from them, <hi>Si feceritis ſicut nos, eritis ſicut nos.</hi> We may imagine we hear our Saviour telling us from Heaven: <hi>If ye do as I did, ye ſhall be as I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, thô Heaven and the Glory of it be freely promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and 'tis no contradiction to ſay, that it is fully purchas'd, and ſufficiently paid for,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.14.</note> being the Apoſtle calls it <hi>a purchaſed poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> yet there muſt be a meetneſs and ſuitableneſs to it, in every one that ſhall be admitted to the fruition of it: We muſt be <hi>made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.12.</note> What ſhould an unholy heart do in Heaven? Heaven would not be Heaven unto it; that is, it could not be a place of Bliſs, and Joy unſpeakable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch. There are no carnal delights, not ſo much as the here lawfull (becauſe neceſſary) ones, of eating and drinking, marrying and giving in mariage: there is no Gold and Silver to fill the Bags of the covetous Earth-worms; no <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s for the Wantons; no Company to debauch and carouze with: If a Sermon or a Lord's day be ſo tedious, when will it be gone? How unhappy would an unchanged, unſanctified Soul think its ſelf to hear perpetual Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah's and Praiſes, to be confined amongſt the Souls of juſt men, and Holy Angels! God certainly will not caſt his Jewels before ſuch Swine.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.23, 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, the Goſpel does by no means take away the ground of that Diſcrimination which will be at the laſt between the Sheep and Goats, between them that ſhall ſtand on the right hand, and on the left, of the Judge of the quick and dead.

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.12.</note> and not reject thee for what thou haſt not.</p>
            <p>But be not miſtaken, as if ſome ſorry wiſhes, and faint endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after Holineſs were ſufficient.

            <p>Though departing from Iniquity is in its ſelf very good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, yet the Motive for ſuch our departing does very much vary it. Our Saviour taxeth the Scribes and Phariſees, that they did all <hi>their works to be ſeen of men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.5.</note> which was as a Fly in the Box of their precious Ointments; any good Action ought to conſiſt <hi>(ex integris cauſis)</hi> of good Cauſes in every reſpect. If the Principle out of which it flows, or End to which it tends be not good, the whole work is marred, it cannot be a good work. Our buſineſs at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is to enquire about the End which we propound in our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in which,</p>
            <p n="1">

            <p n="2">(2.) To depart from Iniquity, or to labour in Holineſs,<note place="margin">But Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, excites us.</note> in order to expreſs our Thankfulneſs unto God, for his mercies in Jeſus Chriſt, is moſt gratefull and moſt forcible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be moſt Acceptable unto God, being it ſpeaks the Soul truly affected with, and ſenſible of God's Free Grace and Mercy.

            <p n="2">2.

Now if Thankfulneſs remain and be cogent, what can oblige more than the Mercies of God in Chriſt? If we ſerve them that give us Food and Rayment, what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is too much for Him that gives us all things? Nay, that gives us Chriſt, and with him all things. Oh! there is a vaſt difference in having Chriſt, (the Peace and Love of God through Him,) in having Chriſt, his Spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to improve what we have from God; and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt with our preſent Enjoyments. Methinks when we ſee our Children or Servants run or go where we would have them, do any thing to pleaſe or gratifie us; we cannot but bluſh to think how little we do, and how awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it is what we do for God.</p>
            <p>Who is it that conſiders the Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and can forbear crying out with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Truly Lord, I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant?</hi>

            <p>He that acts according to any of Gods Commandments, out of hope to merit by them, may act out of Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it muſt be then <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> to obtain, as he vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinks, by his Obedience, Eternal Happineſs.

               <p>One difference there is indeed betwixt the Law and the Goſpel: The Law required the full tale of Brick, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded no Straw: It required Obedience, but the Law (as ſuch) afforded no means to perform it.

            <p>THESE words are a conſiderable part of that excellent Prayer put up to God by the Apoſtle, for his beloved <hi>Epheſians:</hi> from <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. to the end. And indeed Prayer was his tryed Engine by which he always could bring down ſupplies of Grace, from the God of all Grace, for his own, and the Souls of others: In this Branch of it, you will eaſily obſerve, he prays for <hi>Grace</hi> the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> the <hi>Mean</hi> to reach that <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He Prays for <hi>Grace the End. That ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> This being the utmoſt of the Souls Perfection, ought to be the height of its Ambition: beyond this we cannot reach, and therefore in the attainment of this we muſt reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He Prays for <hi>Grace the Mean</hi> to compaſs that <hi>End, viz. To know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> As we grow up into a greater Meaſure of the knowledge of the Love of Chriſt to us, we ſhall enjoy more of the fulneſs of God in us.</p>
            <p>But here we meet, in each of theſe parts of the Text, with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or a ſeeming contradiction in the Terms. <hi>To know the Love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge?</hi> What is that, but to know what is <hi>unknowable?</hi> And <hi>to be filled with all the fulneſs of God?</hi> What is that, but to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, what is <hi>incomprehenſible?</hi> The narrow veſſel of our Heart can no more contain the boundleſs, and bottomleſs Ocean of the Divine
<pb facs="tcp:40119:62"/> fulneſs, than our weak intellectual Eye can drink in the glorious Light of that knowledge.</p>
            <p>And yet there are many ſuch expreſſions in the Holy Scripture: Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> Hebr. 11.27. <hi>ſaw him that was inviſible.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He ſaw him by the Eye of Faith, in the glaſs of a Revelation, whom he could not ſee by the Eye of Reaſon, in the glaſs of Creation: And thus we are inſtructed in the Goſpel, how <hi>to approach</hi> that God who is <hi>unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. To approach that God by Jeſus Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Terms of the New Covenant, to whom conſidered abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, in himſelf we could never approach.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore firſt clear and remove the obſcurity of the Phraſes, that we may more comfortably handle the Divine matter contained in them; Always taking along with us this uſeful caution, That we run not away with a ſwelling metaphor, and from thence form in our minds rude, undigeſted Notions of Spiritual things; nor fancy we ſee Miracles, when we ſhould content our ſelves with Marvels.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">(1.)</note>The former of theſe ſeeming repugnances, is, <hi>To know the Love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge?</hi> If this love of Chriſt paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; why do we pray, why ſhould we ſtrive to know it? If it be our duty to pray that we may know it, how is it ſuppoſed to paſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Muſt we endeavour to reach that which is above all heights? To fathom that which is an Abyſs and has no bottom? Or to take the Dimenſions of that, which is unmeaſurable?</p>
            <p>To remove this difficulty, there have been many expedients found out. 1.<note place="margin">I.</note> Some carry the ſenſe thus; <hi>To know the Love of Chriſt, which paſſeth,</hi> or ſurpaſſeth <hi>the knowledge of all other things:</hi> There is an excellency, an uſefulneſs in the knowledge, of Chriſts Love, which is not to be found in the knowledgc of any thing elſe. A man may know to his own pride, to the Admiration of others, he may have the knowledge of all Tongues, and Languages; may underſtand all Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may dive deep into the ſecrets of Nature; may be profound in Worldly Policies, may have the Theory of all Religions true and falſe, and yet when he comes to caſt up his Accounts, ſhall find himſelf, never the better, never the holier, indeed never the wiſer, never the nearer ſatisfaction till he can reach this bleſſed knowledge of the Love of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Only the excellency of the knowledge of the Love of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts herein.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be a knowledge of Chriſts Love by way of <hi>Appropriation,</hi> to know with the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. That <hi>he loved me, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>efficacious Operation;</hi> Rev. 1.5. That <hi>he loved us, and waſht us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of <hi>Reflection;</hi> that his Love has kindled a mutual Love in our Souls to him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By way of <hi>practical Subjection;</hi> when his Love ſubdues our Hearts to himſelf, and conſtrains us to new obedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, <hi>The Love
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40119:62"/> of Chriſt conſtrains us;</hi> it reſtrains us from ſinning againſt him, and engages us to obey him: To know, that we may know, and make knowledge the end of it ſelf is nothing but vain curioſity: To know that we may be known, is nothing but vainglorious arrogancy. To know that we may make others know, is indeed an edifying charity; but to know that we may be transformed into the image and likeneſs of what we know of the Love of Chriſt, this is the true, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the tranſcendent way of knowledge; And this was that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, and of his Love, which the Apoſtle ſet ſuch a price upon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. when he <hi>determined not to know any thing, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified:</hi> That he might there ſee the Love of Chriſt ſtreaming out of his heart, at his wounds in his blood; and there ſee Divine Juſtice ſatisfied, the Law fulfilled, and thence feel his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence purified, and pacified, and his Soul engaged, and quicken'd to walk in all new obedience; This is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The <hi>tranſcendent knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> in compariſon of which all other things were <hi>loſs, and droſs, and dung;</hi> That he <hi>might know Chriſt, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made conformable to his Death,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 10. And this is one way of clearing the difficulty, and reconciling the ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others have recourſe to a <hi>Hyperbaton:</hi> and would clear the <hi>Thing</hi> by tranſpoſing the <hi>words:</hi> And they order the words thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>To know the ſurpaſſing Love of the knowledge of Chriſt;</hi> and then the ſenſe will be this, <hi>I pray that you may know that ſurpaſſing, that incomparable Love of God, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in giving you the knowledge of Chriſt.</hi> And it muſt be for ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that this was a marvellous inſtance of the Love of God, that he was pleaſed to Communicate to the World the knowledge of a Redeemer; but yet it ſeems rather to impoveriſh the ſenſe, than to give us the full import of the expreſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no need to fly to Critical Niceties, nor to call in Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick, and its figures to our Relief. The words will be conſiſtent, and freed from all appearance of ſelf-contradiction if we attend to theſe following Poſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which cannot be known by a meer humane underſtanding, may yet be underſtood by the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>which ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. And the Spirit of God is given for this end, to <hi>ſhed abroad the Love of God,</hi> (and ſo the Love of Chriſt) <hi>in our Hearts,</hi> Rom. 5.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which cannot be fully known of the Love of Chriſt in this preſent ſtate, where our underſtandings are very much clouded, and our faith weak thro' the remainders of inward Corruption, yet ſhall be more gloriouſly known when we come to ſee God in Chriſt, face to face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Now we know but in part, but then we ſhall know as we are alſo known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:63"/>3. Although there be much of the Love of Chriſt which paſſes all our preſent knowledge, yet there's enough of that Love that may be known: enough to feed our knowledge, that it ſtarve not, in this life, and yet to whet the edge of the Souls appetite to know more in the life to come; enough to guide us, and conduct us thro' our pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and abundance more reſerv'd for our portion. The Love of Chriſt has <hi>Depths</hi> in it wherein the daring Soul may drown, and yet thoſe <hi>ſhallows</hi> wherein the humble Soul may ſafely wade, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bathe it ſelf, without danger of being ſwallowed up: And we have ſome parallel expreſſions in Scripture, which may well illuſtrate this of the Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The peace of God paſſes all underſtanding:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it exceeds all conception, and yet there is that in the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> which may be conceived and expreſſed too; even ſomething of that inward ſatisfaction which ariſes from a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope that our peace is made with God, and that peace copied out upon, and exemplified in a pure and quiet Conſcience: ſo in the verſe following my Text, we read that <hi>God is able to do exceeding abundantly</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>above that we can ask and think:</hi> and yet we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſomething of what God will do for us, and cloath thoſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with ſuitable expreſſions, and make our humble Addreſſes to him for what he has promiſed to give to us, and do for us in ſuch a way as ſhall be acceptable to God thro' the Intereſt of our Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt. In a word, <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>could not ſee Gods face and live,</hi> Exod. 33.20. And yet <hi>Moſes</hi> could <hi>not live except he ſaw Gods face:</hi> ſo is there a meaſure, a degree of the knowledge of the Love of Chriſt, which we cannot reach if we would die for't; and yet there is ſuch a meaſure, ſuch a Degree of the knowledge of that Love of Chriſt, which we muſt reach, or we die for't: And hence I will briefly touch upon two Propoſitions.</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>I. Prop. <hi>There is ſomething in the Love of Chriſt, which in this preſent ſtate ſurpaſſes all perfect knowledge of it:</hi> Something of which we may ſay as one ſaid of a Learned Book: If that which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand be ſo admirable, what is that which I do not underſtand?</head>
               <p>Take any one myſtery of the Goſpel, and when we have purſued it as far as our faculties are able to trace it, we muſt be forced to make a ſtand, and as <hi>Paul</hi> upon the ſhore of the Ocean of Gods unſearchable, untraceable Counſels, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. to cry out, <hi>O the Depth!</hi> or as <hi>Job</hi> chap. 26.14. <hi>Lo, theſe are parts of his ways, and how little a portion is heard of him!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things that are unmeaſurable; The <hi>evil of ſin,</hi> and <hi>the Love of a Saviour:</hi> And the Love of a Saviour muſt be therefore unmeaſurable to the ſinner, becauſe the evil of ſin is unmeaſurable. He that knows not the exceeding greatneſs of his debt, can never ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the exceeding greatneſs of his Love that became a ſurety for it: He that cannot meaſure the greatneſs of the Curſe he lay under, can never meaſure the Love of his Deliverer: And he that never could
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40119:63"/> fully eſtimate the miſery of his bondage, can never fully value or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aright of the Love of his Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The evil of his is unmeaſurable: It is ſo whether we conſider the <hi>Object</hi> againſt whom ſin is committed, or the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> which ſin hath deſerved, or the <hi>Agonies</hi> which the Redeemer ſuffer'd to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider ſin as committed againſt an infinite God, ſo ſin is infinite objectively, and therefore unmeaſurable: the malignity of ſin is unconceivable, it ſtrikes at the Authority, the Glory, the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the chiefeſt Good: Every ſin would in its tendency dethrone the moſt High.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If we conſider the demerit of ſin, it is that which paſſes all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knows the power of thine anger?</hi> We cannot take the juſt, and Adequate meaſure of that wrath which is due to ſin, by all the Plagues, and Judgments by which God ever bore witneſs againſt the evil of ſin: The fire of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> was dreadful fire, but yet it was quencht, a little time extinguiſht it; but that fire of wrath which burns upon, but never burns up ſinners is inextinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The fire is inextinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: It is <hi>everlaſting puniſhment, Matth.</hi> 25.46. The Deluge that drowned the old World argued great Diſpleaſure againſt ſinners, yet neither was that a juſt meaſure of Gods wrath that is due to ſin: for the waters of the Deluge were ſoon dryed up; but ſo will not the Floods of Divine Vengeance poured out upon ſinners to the uttermoſt: for <hi>the breath</hi> (that is, the anger) <hi>of the Lord as a ſtream of fire, and brimſtone kindles,</hi> and feeds the matter of thoſe flames. The Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> were exceeding great demonſtrations of Divine anger againſt ſin, yet they were determinate for number and duration, and ſo could not give us a juſt meaſure of the demerits of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we conſider the ſufferings of Chriſt, they will prove that the evil of ſin is unmeaſurable; they were ſuch as could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and therefore the Ancient Chriſtians uſed, in their Prayers, to beg of Chriſt that he would deliver them, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>by thy unknown torments, Lord deliver us!</hi> And hence we may infer, that the Love of Chriſt muſt needs be unmeaſurable, becauſe he delivered us from unmeaſurable wrath, by unconceivable torments.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Love of Chriſt to ſinners is unmeaſurable, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> We have no ſcale in nature, in which we can weigh; no line in created things by which we can meaſure it.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. If we examine the love of Relations, we find them all limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bounded, and they ought to be ſo: The love of a Father to a child is an intenſe love; the love of a Father to an undutiful child, a rebellious child, may ſtretch the line ſomewhat farther, yet this will fall vaſtly ſhort of the Love of Chriſt to ſinners. The higheſt inſtance of this love that I remember was that of <hi>David</hi> to his rebellious Son <hi>Abſalom,</hi> expreſſed 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. <hi>O</hi> Abſalom <hi>my ſon! my ſon! would
<pb facs="tcp:40119:64"/> God I had died for thee, O</hi> Abſalom <hi>my Son! my Son!</hi> Here is Paternal love ſtrained up to the higheſt pitch imaginable; That a King ſhould deſire to die for a Rebellious Subject; that a Father ſhould be willing to die for the moſt diſingenuous and rebellious of Sons: This was great; but yet we find this love extended but to a natural death; he would have been unwilling to have died a Curſed death, to have been made a Curſe for him; to have been made ſin for him: And yet the torrent of this impetuous love ſoon dryed up; it was founded in paſſion rather than judgment, and perhaps in cool blood, he would have been unwilling to have died that ſuch a wretch might live: I queſtion much whether <hi>David</hi> durſt deliberately, adviſedly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditately, have laid down his life to ſave that of a vitious debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Son; yet ſuch was the Love of Chriſt, who laid down his life for ſinners, the greateſt of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And laid it down vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, when none could take it away, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. and not only died againſt the perſuaſions of his friends to ſave his life, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.32. but againſt that bitter malice of his Enemies, which always ſparkled, and at laſt flamed out in the moſt cruel, bloody, implacable fury that ever was in the World; nay, againſt the juſt diſpleaſure of God as a Judge, all which he had a clear proſpect into, and yet gave this great pregnant proof of his unconquerable Love, that he not only poured out his Soul <hi>in tears,</hi> Luke 19.41. his Soul <hi>in prayers,</hi> Luke 23.34. <hi>Father forgive them:</hi> but his Soul <hi>in ſacrifice</hi> too, unto the death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12.</p>
               <p>But if the love of a Father to his Son will not meaſure this Love of Chriſt, perhaps the love of a Mother to her Son may: And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed naturally the more ſoft and paſſionate Sex; and of this love the caſe is put, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her Womb?</hi> The caſe is put ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrong. A Child, a ſucking Child, that hangs upon the breaſt and is always crying for pity, in its natural dialect; the Son of the Womb, that's more than the Child of the breaſt; ſhe can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that at any rate, which ſhe brought forth at ſuch a dear rate: yet the circumſtances may be ſuch, that this tender Mother may forſake, and forget, nay kill, and deſtroy too, this innocent Child; ſuch exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences they have been in, that Nature has prov'd unnatural; or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in one inſtance has overcome Nature in another: A Mothers hunger, has caus'd her to forget her pity to the Child of her Womb, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.10. <hi>The hands of the pitiful Women have ſodden their own child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren:</hi> to forſake, to forget, to kill, to cook, and at laſt to eat, is certainly the greateſt ſtemming of the current, and ſtream of natural affection that we can conceive of: but Chriſt's Love will not ſuffer him to forget, to forſake; he has oftens forgotten himſelf, to remember them; he has forgotten his own food, that he might provide for their Souls, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. he has forgotten his own approaching death, that he might provide for their life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>The ſame night in which he was betrayed he took bread,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:40119:64"/>
               <p>And yet perhaps the love of the Husband to his Wife, may come up to this example of Love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it:</hi> Here's an argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to enforce that conjugal Love; and here's a preſident for conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Love to look upon: but that <hi>[As]</hi> is not a note of <hi>equality,</hi> but of ſome <hi>general ſimilitude:</hi> for the Husband gives himſelf to his Wife, but will not, is not bound to die for his Wife: he cannot be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have her ſins charg'd upon his Soul: How ſhort are all the Loves, the Affections of Relations to give us a pattern and example of the Love of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>But poſſibly we may find a love in Nature more ſtrong than any of theſe: And that, if any where, muſt be amongſt ſome of thoſe great inſtances of Love which have been amongſt friends: It is indeed ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1, 3. That <hi>Jonathan loved David as his own Soul;</hi> and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. The friend is ſaid to be <hi>as a Mans own Soul.</hi> But yet when we come to examine theſe expreſſions, they fade away, and ſignifie nothing but <hi>the life;</hi> where is the friend that will make his Soul an offering for ſin? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. However this is the higheſt flight that ever humane love took, to lay down life for a friend; but Chriſt has put this quite out of countenance, <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love has no man than that he lay down his life for his friend;</hi> but a far greater Love than this had Chriſt, that he laid down his life for enemies. Chriſt laid down a better life, for them that were worſe. And this is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to our conſideration, as that which has out-done all the love in the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>Scarcely for a righteous Man will one die:</hi> No, I think its out of queſtion that none will; for who would be ſo friendly to him, that walks by the rules of ſtrict juſtice; that will do no wrong, yet ſhews no mercy? <hi>but peradventure for a good Man ſome would even dare to die:</hi> If there be an inſtance found in the World of any that has laid down his life for another, it muſt be for <hi>a good Man;</hi> one that is a publick bleſſing to the age wherein he lives, ſome one may throw away his private life, which is not very uſeful, for ſo generous a Perſon, that is a Common good to his Country; but if ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be found, which is but <hi>a peradventure;</hi> we have that which will ſhut it out of all conſideration, and eclipſe that which otherwiſe might have had ſome luſtre, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>God commends his love to us that when we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. If the love of relations will not afford us a juſt Meaſure for the Love of Chriſt; let's ſee if there be any thing elſe in the whole ſcale of Nature that may furniſh us with a line commenſurate to it: And we can no ſooner think of making the Inquiry, but we propoſe to our ſelves, the height of Heaven, the breadth of the Earth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.3. <hi>The Heaven for height, and the Earth for breadth:</hi> but we muſt deſpair of finding any thing that may meaſure, or circumſcribe this love, ſince the Apoſtle has aſſured us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. that the <hi>riches of Chriſt are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable,</hi>

The treaſures of Gold, and Silver, which wiſe providence has hid ſo deep in the bowels of the Earth, yet the vein may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſo far, till its worn out; but this treaſure of Love in the Heart of Chriſt, is ſo deep, and is ſo rich that we can neither find out nor exhauſt the fulneſs of it: when God would give us ſome ſhadow of his Love, he repreſents it by the height of the Heavens; not that his Love reaches no higher, but becauſe there's nothing in created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture higher to repreſent it by, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11. <hi>As the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his Mercy towards them that fear him.</hi> The Love of God is only to be meaſur'd by it ſelf, that is by himſelf, for <hi>God is Love,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. No Creature, no Saint, no Angel, can fadom the Love of Gods heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11. <hi>I know the thoughts that I think to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we muſt ſay the ſame of Chriſt's Love; there's one Dimenſion more in the Love of Chriſt, than in the Creation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18. <hi>That you may be able to comprehend, with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>We are taught to diſtinguiſh between the meaſure of a Man and the meaſure of God: All bodies have but three dimenſions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. <hi>He meaſured the City with a Reed, twelve thouſand furlongs; the length, the breadth, the height were equal, according to the meaſure of a Man;</hi> but in the meaſuring Spiritual, Heavenly things, ſuch as are the Love of God, and of Chriſt, there's one dimenſion more: So we have it in that ſublime diſcourſe of <hi>Zophar, Job</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. <hi>Canſt thou by ſearching find out God, canſt thou find out the Almighty to perfection? It is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do? Deeper then Hell, what canſt thou know? The meaſure thereof is longer then the Earth, and broader then the Sea.</hi> And thus we are taught modeſty, and not to limit God, and his purpoſes of Love by our narrow conceptions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8. <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, for as the Heavens are higher then the Earth, ſo are my thoughts then your thoughts, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And 1. for the <hi>Breadth</hi> of the Love of Chriſt; It reaches Jews, and Gentiles, it extends to all ranks of Men, high and low, rich and poor: it reaches all the caſes of Men's Souls; the Tempted, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, the Backſlider, and Perſecutor; it reaches the bruiſed Reed, the ſmoaking Flax; it extends to the pardon of all ſins truly repented of: ſo that we may ſay that his <hi>promiſes,</hi> which are the vehicles of Truth and Love, <hi>are exceeding broad,</hi> as well as his <hi>Precepts,</hi> which are the indications of his Authority, and Power: The Love of Chriſt is wider than <hi>Mans will, Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>All the day long I have ſtretched out my hands unto a diſobedient and gainſaying people:</hi> Its wider than <hi>Mans power,</hi> for <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No Man can come unto me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. <hi>All that the Father has given me ſhall come unto me.</hi> It is wider than all our <hi>wants, and neceſſities;</hi> there's more bread in his houſe, than there are hungry Souls to eat; more manſions in Heaven than there are Souls to fill; its wider than <hi>our capacities,</hi> and we may ſooner <hi>enter into our Maſters joy,</hi> Matth. 25.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40119:65"/> than that joy can enter into us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. It cannot <hi>enter into the heart of Man what things God has prepared for them that love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The length of the Love of Chriſt:</hi> An extent of Grace, and Love that reaches Souls at the greateſt diſtance: It reacht <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in the heat, and height of his deſperate fury; mad, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately mad, with an inveterate enmity againſt Chriſt: It reacht <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> when ſhe was poſſeſt with ſeven Devils; it reacht the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> when they were far off from God, eſtranged from the light, and life of God by their Abominable Idolatries, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Ye who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were a far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt:</hi> It reacht the <hi>Prodigal</hi> when he was far off, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. And as it finds and reaches Souls at the greateſt diſtance of ſin, and enmity, ſo it reaches a length, which we cannot with conſiſtence of thought conceive of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Able to ſave to the utmoſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>The depth of the Love of Chriſt:</hi> And here unleſs we could ſound the depth of our Miſery, we can never fadom the depth of Chriſts Love; unleſs we could <hi>know the power of Gods Anger,</hi> Pſal. 90.11. we can never reach the power of Chriſts Love: The Torments of Hell are unknown Torments, and thoſe Torments which Chriſt endured in his Soul, to deliver us from thence, were unknown Torments: The Love of Chriſt does not only reach the depth of our Miſery, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sin, but thoſe depths of Sorrow into which ſometimes even holy Souls are plunged by Deſertion: The Pſalmiſt <hi>cryed unto God out of the Depth;</hi> Divine Love heard him and reacht him there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.1. <hi>Jonah</hi> cryed unto God <hi>out of the belly of Hell:</hi> Divine Love heard him there and deliver'd him thence, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.2. <hi>Heman</hi> was plunged <hi>in the loweſt pit, in darkneſs, in the deeps;</hi> yet Love reacht him in that ſad, and diſmal condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The height of the Love of Chriſt:</hi> All the meaſure of the height of Chriſts Love we can take, is to ſay its unmeaſurable; <hi>It is high, we cannot attain unto it,</hi> Pſal. 139.6. his Love reaches the Soul on Earth, and never leaves it, till it has conducted it to Heaven; he Loves Grace into the Soul, and Loves the Soul into Glory; what that Glory is, Go and ſee! The taſte of it, is to be had here, the feaſt is reſerved for hereafter; wrath to come, and life to come are unconceivable, and therefore unexpreſſible; we can neither order our Speech by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our inward darkneſs, nor of that ineffable Light, thoughts fail us, words fail us; we are loſt in the thoughts of future bleſſedneſs, as well as in thoſe of our former miſery! What therefore we cannot perfectly underſtand, let us ſilently, and reverently Admire, and Adore! What a prodigious height did Man fall from, when he fell from his God? What a deſperate Abyſs of miſery did he fall into when he fell into ſin? And therefore what a ſtupendious height is that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:66"/> which Love ſhall raiſe him to in Glory? All we can do, is to put no bounds to our Love to Chriſt: The true meaſure of our Love to Chriſt, ſhould be to Love him without meaſure; and the true degree of our Love to a Redeemer is to Love him in the higheſt Degree; But alas! Where is our Love to Chriſt? How weakly do we expreſs our Love to him, who has given us the fulleſt, cleareſt demonſtrations of his to us, beyond all expreſſions! His was <hi>ſtronger then death,</hi> ours ready to die; the water-floods coulds not quench his, a few drops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh ours; he ſhed blood for us with more freedom, than we a few tears over him, and his bleeding, almoſt dying intereſt in the World; he loved ſinners better than we can love Saints; he died for us with more flame of zeal, than we can live to, and for him: Let us be aſhamed that we can find a love ſo vehement for our periſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, nay for our killing corruptions, and yet have ſo indifferent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for a Saviour! How ſhall we be able to Love our enemies for his ſake, when we can neither Love him with an intenſe Love for his ſake, nor our own? Let us mourn therefore bitterly that the Love of Chriſt ſhould be unconceivable, and inviſible, and that our Love to him ſhould be ſo too, upon ſuch different accounts; his for the greatneſs of it, ours for its ſmallneſs.</p>

                  <hi>II. Prop.</hi> There is a ſufficiency of the Love of Chriſt to us that may be known.</head>
               <p>The Love of Chriſt to ſinners may be conſidered either in the cauſe, or as in the effects; in the Spring and Fountain, or in the ſtreams that flow from thence into Souls: Love as it was in the heart of Chriſt is unmeaſurable; the Spring, the original cauſe and reaſon of it, was his own unaccountable Love, and can only be meaſured by the Love of the Father to his Son, which is equally unmeaſurable, <hi>John</hi> 15.9. <hi>As the Father has loved me, ſo I have loved you:</hi> But Chriſts Love in the effects, that it has been pleas'd to produce in, and upon our Souls, may be underſtood, and in ſome good meaſure apprehended: If we cannot fix our eyes immediately upon the body of the Sun in its meridian glory, yet we may comfortably refreſh our ſelves with its beams, and feel the healing warmth of the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſing and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon our Souls; If we cannot meaſure Chriſts Love when it dealt with God, in making his Soul an offering for ſin; nor what that Love was wherewith <hi>he loved us, and gave himſelf for us,</hi> Gal. 2.20. yet we may know that Love wherewith <hi>he loved us, and waſht us from our ſins,</hi> Rev. 1.5. The Love of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> paſſes knowledge, the Love of <hi>Sanctification</hi> may be known: As that poor Man, <hi>John</hi> 9.15. tho' he could not give a Philoſophical account to the Scribes and Phariſees, how Clay and Spittle ſhould contribute to the opening his Eyes, yet could ſay, <hi>This one thing, I know, that whereas I was born blind I now ſee.</hi> So may a renewed Soul ſay, Tho' I know not from what unmeaſurable Fountain this Grace and Mercy did proceed; tho' I am ignorant of the manner of its working, yet this one thing I can ſay, Whereas I
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40119:66"/> was a lover of ſin, I now hate it; and whereas I have been a deſpiſer of Chriſt, I now prize, and love him as the chiefeſt of Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. I can ſay, That that vanity, that corruption which ſometime had a mighty power over me, is now ſubdued and conquered. More particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Altho' we cannot perfectly know the Love of Chriſt, yet may we know ſo much of it, as may raiſe our deſires to know more: As he that meets with a Vein of precious Metal, tho' it be ſmall, yet it gives him hopes of meeting with more, and thoſe hopes encourage his labours to dig deeper and ſearch further; ſo that little we can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the knowledge of Chriſts Love in our wayfaring ſtate, makes the Soul labour and ſtrive, and hope and pray, that it may come to fuller knowledge of that love in its own Country.</p>
               <p>As that ſight which <hi>Moſes</hi> had of God, encouraged him to pray, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy glory:</hi> So that view we have of Chriſt <hi>in a glaſs darkly,</hi> ſerves to engage our endeavours, and ſharpen our deſires to ſee him face to face in glory. As we gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knowledge of Chriſt, ſo we grow, and as it were encroach upon him ſtill; if God will condeſcend, and come down to viſit the Soul, the Soul will make an argument from thence, that he would take it up to himſelf: A taſte of Chriſts Love, whets the Spiritual appetite after a feaſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born babes deſire ye the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby. If ſo be you have taſted that the Lord is gracious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. However our knowledge of Chriſts Love is imperfect, yet we may know ſo much as may ſhame us that we have loved him no better; we know the Love of Chriſt carried him out to ſuffer moſt dreadful things upon our account, and may hence reflect upon our ſelves with great ſhame, that our love has been ſo weak as not to carry us out to ſuffer for his Name; he endured the croſs, we are terrified at the ſight of it: The argument is very ſtrong, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. Thus if Chriſt <hi>laid down his life for us, we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren:</hi> But how weakly does it work upon us? How little a matter can this love conſtrain us to lay down for their ſakes? And its a moſt concluding argument, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13. that we ſhould <hi>forbear and forgive one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, as Chriſt forgave us;</hi> but alas! how little does this inſtance of the Love of Chriſt prevail upon us? That Love which prevail'd with him to forgive us Talents, will not, does not prevail with us to forgive our brethren a few Pence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.27, 28. The Love of Chriſt was a conquering, a triumphant Love, it bore down what-ever ſtood in its way: It grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the diſpleaſure of God, with the malice of Devils, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of unreaſonable Men, and with the unkindneſs of his Friends, it broke through all Diſcouragements, and trampled upon all Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>waters could not quench it, the floods could not drown it,</hi> Cant. 8.7. So much we know, and may bluſh, that our Love to Chriſt is ſo eaſily quenched, diſcouraged, and diſheartned.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:40119:67"/>3. Although our knowledge of Chriſt be imperfect, yet ſo much we may know as may ſerve to guide and encourage our obedience to him: All our knowledge of Chriſt is vain, all our love to him is a pretenſe, if we know him not that we may love him, and love him not that we may keep his Commandments, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;</hi> for as that is not reputed with God to be any obedience, which is not performed by a principle of love, ſo neither is that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as any love, that is not productive of obedience: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt over us is the reaſon of our obedience, but the Love of Chriſt in us is the true principle of that obedience, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:</hi> Chriſt will not acknowledge any Man to love him that does not ſerve him: And as the Love of Chriſt was an univerſal Love, it extended to all our Spiritual neceſſities; ſo muſt our Love to Chriſt, be as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and have a ſincere reſpect to all his Commandments: And upon lower terms than theſe, Chriſt will not own our love to be any thing, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends if you do whatſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Although we cannot perfectly underſtand the Love of Chriſt, in this our preſent ſtate, yet may we know ſo much of his Love as ſhall be of more true uſe and worth than all we know beſides; we may know ſomething of God, and know it to our terror and confuſion: There may be ſuch rays of Divine knowledge let into a guilty Soul, as may make it wiſh it could ſhut them out again: And hence it is, that ſinners ſay, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy ways.</hi> The moſt ungrateful, unwelcom thing to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner in the World, is to ſee God, and to be convinced that God ſees him: That Gods omniſcience looks into his rotten heart; and the ſinner muſt needs ſit very uneaſie under this knowledge of God, till he can ſee God reconciled to him in Chriſt, and have the light of that knowledge comfortably <hi>ſhinning into his heart in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6.</p>
               <p>There is no knowledge to be compared with the knowledge of God; no knowledge of God comparable to the knowledge of God as reconciled in Chriſt; no knowledge of Chriſt to be compared with the knowledge of his Love, nor any knowledge of his Love to be compared with that knowledge of it, which ſubdues our hearts to his obedience, transforms our Souls into his likeneſs, and raiſes up the Soul to aſpire after his enjoyment. Thus it is that <hi>we joy in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the atonement,</hi> Rom. 5.11.</p>
               <p>All other knowledge may ſwell the head, ſooner than better the heart or reform the life: A Man may go ſilently down to Hell by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; he may go triumphantly thither by open prophaneneſs, and he may go Learnedly down to Hell with great pomp and oſtentation, what-ever he knows, if he knows not the Love of Chriſt, ruling in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40119:67"/> him, and giving Laws to him, and conforming him both to the Death, and Reſurrection of his Saviour.</p>
               <p>And let this ſuffice to have ſpoken of the ſecond Propoſition: That <hi>tho' the Love of Chriſt in its higheſt elevation paſſes all perfect knowledge, in our preſent dark imperfect ſtate, yet there's enough of the Love of Chriſt that may be known, to engage our deſires and endeavours to know more, to ſhame us that we know ſo little of what may be known; to engage our hearts to him, and make us confeſs that whatever elſe we know without this, is not worth the knowing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the ſecond part of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apoſtles Prayer, for <hi>Grace the End: That ye might be filled with all the fulneſs of God,</hi> wherein we meet with a ſecond <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſomething that implies a contradiction in appearance.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle prays that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might, and certainly we ought to add our Prayers to his, that we may; and to ſecond our Prayers with endeavours, that God would <hi>fill us with all his fulneſs:</hi> And yet we are here aground again, To be filled with Gods <hi>fulneſs?</hi> With <hi>all his fulneſs,</hi> ſeems rather the object of our Deſpair, than of our Prayer; 'tis that which ſtartles Faith, diſcourages Hope, which ſuperſedes Prayer and Endeavour; for how can our finite graſp his Infinite? Our narrow veſſel comprehend the Sea of his Divine perfections? We can no more comprehend the incomprehenſible of God, than we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the unapprehenſible Love of Chriſt: Our hearts muſt needs be narrow, becauſe our minds are ſo; we can ſee but little, we can love no more than we can ſee: what the Eye cannot behold, the Hand cannot hold.</p>
               <p>For the ſolution of this, I ſhall only obſerve at the preſent, That as there is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>that which may be known of God,</hi> Rom. 1.19. and the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that which cannot be known of God; in which reſpect we are like the Athenians, and erect our Altar <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>to the unknown God,</hi> Acts 17.23. ſo there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which may be comprehended of God, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that which cannot be comprehended, in which reſpects we are all ſcepticks, and muſt confeſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I cannot comprehend it.</p>
               <p>For the clearing therefore of this difficulty, perhaps we may have ſome relief from the Original; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we may render thus, <hi>That ye may be fill'd unto all that fulneſs of God.</hi> There is a meaſure of Grace unto which the Divine Wiſdom has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Believers; unto that meaſure, that degree of fulneſs we ought to aſpire, and to pray that God would fill us with it; which ſeems to be the purport of that other Prayer of this Apoſtle for the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.11. <hi>We pray always for you, that God would fulfil all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. God is the Fountain, his Saints are Veſſels: Theſe Veſſels are of ſeveral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; God according to his good pleaſure has gaged theſe Veſſels; now it is our duty to pray and ſtrive, to ſtrive and pray, that God from the inexhauſtible Fountain of his goodneſs would fill theſe Veſſels
<pb facs="tcp:40119:68"/> with Grace up to the brim; and that according to that capacity which God has graciouſly beſtowed he would graciouſly fill up that capacity. For if you ſhould pour the whole Ocean upon a Veſſel, yet it receives only according to its own Dimenſions: And this is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who when he had recited, and rejected, ſome other interpretations, fixes on this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I conceive (ſays he) this to be the beſt interpretation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>That ye may be perfect in every Divine perfection, knowing all Spiritual things as far as 'tis poſſible.</hi> Seeing then there is a fulneſs of God which we cannot comprehend, cannot receive; and yet there is ſomething of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God which we may receive, it will be ſeaſonable to propound that Queſtion which has been recommended to our Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Queſtion, <hi>What is that fulneſs of God which every true Chriſtian ought to pray, and ſtrive to be filled with?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Inquiry will oblige us to ſpeak ſomething by way of Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then ſomething further by way of direct Solution.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. That which is neceſſary to be ſpoken by way of Suppoſition, will fall under theſe two Heads; That there is a fulneſs in God, and of God, which we cannot be filled with; And that there is a fulneſs of God with which we may, and therefore ought to pray and ſtrive to be filled with.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> It is preſuppoſed to this Inquiry, <hi>That there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God, with which we cannot be filled, and therefore ought not to pray, ought not to ſtrive to be filled with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the deſtructive ſuggeſtion and temptation of Satan, to perſuade our firſt Parents to be ambitious of being <hi>like to God,</hi> Gen. 3.5. <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods:</hi> And the Tempter never ſhew'd himſelf to be more a Devil, than when he proſecuted this Deſign; nor did Man ever fall more below himſelf, than when he was blown up to an Ambition to be above himſelf: It is the perfection, the glory, the happineſs of the Rational creature to be like unto God, in his communicable Attributes: It is the deſtruction, the ruin of the Rational creatures to aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a likeneſs to God in his incommunicable ones; And 'tis a ſinful am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition too to aſpire after a likeneſs to God even in his communicable Attributes, and perfections in that way, wherein they are in God; ſo that it may be our deſtruction to aſpire after a conformity to God, and it may be our perfection to aſpire after a conformity to him.</p>
               <p>For firſt, God is eſſentially full of all Divine excellencies, he is ſo <hi>by nature,</hi> by eſſence; what we are, we are <hi>by Grace:</hi> 'Tis not much we have, and that little is Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>By the grace of God, I am that I am:</hi> Holineſs is not our eſſence, there was a time when we were not holy; we were born without it, and may die without it; but if we die as empty of Grace as we were born, it had been good for us never to have been born.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:40119:68"/>
               <p>Secondly, The holineſs of God is a <hi>Self-holineſs;</hi> God is not only full, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> but ſelf-full, full with his own fulneſs; he lends to all, borrows of none: But the fulneſs of a Believer is a borrowed, a precarious ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we depend on God for the beginning and begetting of Grace; for the encreaſing and nouriſhing of that Grace he has begotten and begun; for the confirming and ſtrengthning that Grace he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; for the perfecting and compleating of that Grace he has confirmed and ſtrengthned, and for the crowning of what he has ſo perfected and compleated. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> upon that, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his fulneſs, we all have received, and grace for grace,</hi> informs us, that Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very Self-fountain. Believers muſt confeſs with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 71.8. That <hi>all our Springs are in him.</hi> Again, that Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very <hi>Self-root:</hi> We muſt freely and thankfully own, that in him <hi>is our fruit found,</hi> Hoſea 14.8. Again, that Chriſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very <hi>Self-life, John</hi> 5.26. <hi>He has Life in himſelf:</hi> That we have, we acknowledge it to be from him, as our Principle, Spring, Root, <hi>with whom is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. And that <hi>the life which we live in the Fleſh, we live by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. In a word, all our Obedience is rooted in the habits of Grace wrought in the Soul, and thoſe habits are all rooted in Chriſt, who, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> goes on, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in himſelf the treaſures of all good things: and not only ſo, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he overflows, and ever flows with Streams of Grace to all the Saints; not only being <hi>full,</hi> but filling others; not only rich, but enriching others; a living Jeſus, and giving Life to others. And thus by Faith engraffed into Chriſt, we partake of the root and of the fatneſs of the Olive-tree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The fulneſs of holineſs of Grace, of all perfections that are in God, are unlimited, boundleſs, and infinite: God is a Sea <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> without a Shoar; an Ocean of Grace without a Bottom: The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Believers is circumſcribed within the bounds and limits of their narrow, and finite Beings: And this finiteneſs of Nature will for ever cleave to the Saints, when they ſhall be enlarged in their Souls to the utmoſt capacity. <hi>Mortal ſhall put on Mortality;</hi> but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſhall never put on Infiniteneſs; <hi>Corruptible ſhall put on Incorruption;</hi> but our meaſured Natures ſhall never put on Immenſity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And hence the fulneſs of God is <hi>inexhauſtible.</hi> As all the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> leſſer Stars repleniſh their Urns with light from the Sun, and yet he's never the leſs full of light. Thus God is called <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> Jam. 1.17. by which ſome think is meant the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> who, as ſo many Lamps are lighted up from the Sun; or elſe the <hi>Father of all Grace,</hi> Comfort, Peace, each of which may be termed <hi>Light.</hi> Now when all the Saints in Earth, all the Angels in Heaven have filled up their Veſſels from this Fountain, yet he is ſtill the ſame infinitely bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all-full God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And the forementioned Father thinks that the ſimilitude of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> the Fountain, and of the Ocean, do not fully expreſs the fulneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:69"/> God: For, if you take but one drop from the Ocean, there is that drop leſs in the Ocean, than there had been, if it had not been taken thence; and therefore we add this laſt Head: That the fulneſs of Goodneſs, Grace, Holineſs, and all other Divine Perfections that are in him are not only <hi>inexhauſtible,</hi> but <hi>undiminiſhable:</hi> For after all the derivations of Grace from the God of Grace, he remains full, and not only ſo, but as he expreſſes it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Not at all leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened by thoſe communications:</hi> Nor need we puzzle our ſelves with this matter, for our Derivations from God are not <hi>eſſential,</hi> but <hi>influential;</hi> the Soul partakes not of the Divine Nature, <hi>materially,</hi> but by way of <hi>efficiency.</hi> Believers are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Not by ſubſtance, but reſemblance; for we muſt hold this as a fixt Principle, that the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> eſſentially conſidered, is not diſcerptible, nor diviſible, and therefore not communicable.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the firſt thing we muſt ſuppoſe, and take as granted, That there is a Fulneſs in God, <hi>viz.</hi> his eſſential ſelf-ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is infinite, inexhauſtible, undiminiſhable, and therefore incommunicable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing we muſt ſuppoſe, is, <hi>That there is a fulneſs of God with which we may, and therefore ought to pray and labour that we may be filled:</hi> We cannot reach the original fulneſs, but we may a borrowed derivative fulneſs; tho' we cannot attain the fulneſs of the Fountain, we may receive a fulneſs of the Veſſel from that Fountain; and if we cannot partake any thing of Gods Eſſence, we may partake of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; we cannot be filled with the formal holineſs of God, for that holineſs is God; yet may we derive holineſs from him as an efficient cauſe, who works <hi>all things according to the counſel of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. The <hi>Wiſdom of God,</hi> there's <hi>Principium dirigens;</hi> the <hi>Will of God,</hi> there's <hi>Principium imperans;</hi> and he <hi>works</hi> according to theſe, there's the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium exequens.</hi> His Will commands, his Wiſdom guides, his Power executes the Decrees and Purpoſes of his wiſe Counſel, and holy Will.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared the way, we proceed to the direct <hi>Solution</hi> of the Queſtion, <hi>What is that fulneſs of God, which every true Chriſtian ought to pray, and ſtrive to be filled with?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſeeing we have ſuppoſed that there is a fulneſs of God, which we cannot be filled with; we muſt lay aſide all ambitions, and vain aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirings after that fulneſs; and ſeeing we have ſuppoſed, that there is a fulneſs of God wherewith we may be filled, and the very Prayer of the Apoſtle ſuppoſes it: We therefore are to take up this holy and humble ambition to be filled with it.</p>
               <p>Now this Queſtion can be no ſooner propoſed, but our thoughts will ſuggeſt to us theſe two things. Firſt, What is the <hi>matter</hi> of that <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> and what is the <hi>meaſure</hi> of that <hi>Fulneſs;</hi> with what of God, and with how much of God ought we to pray and ſtrive, that we may be filled? And therefore of neceſſity we muſt divide the Queſtion into theſe <hi>two Branches.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:40119:69"/>
               <p>Firſt Branch of the Queſtion. <hi>What is the matter of that Fulneſs of God which we are to pray, and ſtrive to be filled with?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſpeak of <hi>Filling,</hi> we conceive immediately that under that Metaphor there muſt be comprized theſe three things: A <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence that Fulneſs is <hi>communicated:</hi> A <hi>Recipient,</hi> a <hi>Veſſel,</hi> a <hi>Ciſtern</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which that Fulneſs is <hi>derived:</hi> And then of ſomething <hi>Analogous to the matter,</hi> which from that Fountain is communicated, and by that Veſſel received. Now in the Caſe before us; This Fountain muſt needs be God, the <hi>Author of every good and perfect Gift,</hi> Jam. 1.17. <hi>Souls</hi> are the Veſſel into which the Fulneſs is received; but what we are to conceive and underſtand by the <hi>matter</hi> (or the <hi>quaſi materia</hi>) with which theſe Veſſels from that Fountain are filled, is the Subject of our preſent Enquiry.</p>
               <p>And to this branch of the main Inquiry I ſhall anſwer, Firſt, more generally. Secondly, more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To ſpeak <hi>generally:</hi> That which we are to pray, and ſtrive to be filled with, is <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> Eph. 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſs, but be ye filled with the Spirit;</hi> where firſt the Apoſtle <hi>dehorts</hi> againſt Intemperance; we may have too much of the beſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things: It's eaſie to run into exceſs in theſe matters: The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt aſſures us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. That <hi>Wine makes glad the heart of man.</hi> And the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. aſſures us too, that <hi>Wine takes away the Heart.</hi> It's no more but this; the Uſe is good, the Abuſe is ſinful; and the danger is, leſt from the lawfulneſs of the Uſe we ſlide inſenſibly into the Abuſe. <hi>Be not therefore filled with wine, wherein is exceſs;</hi> but then he <hi>exhorts</hi> too, <hi>But be ye filled with the Spirit:</hi> No fear of exceſs, or Intemperance in this caſe; when God fills the Souls of his People with his Spirit, he fills them with all the Spiritual good things that their hearts can fill their Prayers with: Compare but theſe two places: <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11. <hi>How much more ſhall your Father which is in Heaven give good things to them that ask him?</hi> Luke 11.13. <hi>How much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe two Scriptures evidently proves, that in praying for the Holy Spirit, we pray virtually for all good things; and that when God is graciouſly pleaſed to communicate his Spirit, he communicates all good things; when the Father gives his Son, he gives all things: So the Apoſtle has taught us to believe, and argue, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 32. <hi>He that ſpared not his Son, but delivered him up for us All; how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> And we have equal reaſon to believe, that he that ſpared his Spirit, and gave him to us, will in him, and with him freely give us all things: But theſe <hi>all things</hi> are to be taken <hi>in ſuo genere:</hi> The Gift of Chriſt comprehends all things that are to be done for us; the gift of the Spirit includes all things to be wrought in us: Chriſt is <hi>all things</hi> for <hi>Juſtification,</hi> the Spirit is <hi>all things</hi> for <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Conſolation.</hi> I ſhall touch at preſent upon ſome few things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="tcp:40119:70"/>1. Do you find an emptineſs of Grace, and do you long to have your Souls repleniſht with it? You go to the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. That he would give you more Faith, more Love, more Patience, more Self-denyal, more Heavenly-mindedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you do well; but the compendious way is, to pray that God would fulfil that Promiſe, and ſo fill your Souls with his Spirit; <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>I will pour out upon the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the Spirit of Grace and Supplication.</hi> Firſt the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> that we may pray; and then the <hi>Spirit of Prayer,</hi> that we may be filled with more Grace: Can we be content with a few drops, when God has promiſed to <hi>pour out his Spirit? John</hi> 7.38. <hi>He that believes in me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water; this ſpake he of the Spirit.</hi> Can we ſatifie our ſelves, that we have ſo much Grace as juſt keeps us alive, when if we would pray and ſtrive for the Spirit, we might be more lively and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Chriſtians? Can we be content with a Taſte, when God has provided a Feaſt? Some of the Ancients, who were anointed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Oyl, were anointed with the <hi>Cruiſe,</hi> others with the <hi>Horn:</hi> O let us not be ſatified that we have a few drops from the Cruiſe, when God is ready to pour out his Grace more abundantly! <hi>John</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would you anſwer the glorious Title of a Child of God with a more glorious and ſuitable Spirit, that you may pray as Children, walk as dear Children? come to God, not as Slaves, but as Children; and walk before God, not under the reſemblance of the Spirit of Bondage, but with an ingenuous Liberty, and Freedom, as becomes the Heirs of Salvation: Pray for the Spirit of God; that he may be a Spirit of Adoption to you, as well as of Regeneration; pray in the Spirit for the Spirit, that you may have the frame of a Child, filled with Zeal for the Fathers Name and Intereſt: 'Tis the <hi>Spirit of Adoption that teaches us to cry Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15. 'Tis the Spirit of God that gives us an inward freedom and liberty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e the Spirit of the Lord is, there's Liberty. This Spirit will not give you a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto ſin, but from it; nor from God, but with him: This Spirit will not break the Bonds of the Commandment, but tye up your hearts to it, and give you liberty and chearfulneſs in it.</p>
               <p>We read that the Son makes us free, <hi>John</hi> 8.36 <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, then are you free indeed:</hi> We read alſo that the Spirit makes us free too, but in different reſpects: The Son makes us free from the Curſe of the Law, from the guilt of Sin, from the Wrath of God; but the Spirit makes us free too, from the reigning power of ſin, from the bondage that is in the Conſcience: The Authority of God has made his Precepts neceſſary; what is neceſſary in the precept, the Spirit makes voluntary in the principle; God charges the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Duty, and the Spirit enlarges the heart to obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandment, when thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Pray for the Spirit, that he would perform his whole Office to you, that you may not partake only of the work of the Spirit in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40119:70"/> ſome one or ſome few of his operations, but in all that are common to Believers. And eſpecially that he that has been an anointing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to you, would be a ſealing Spirit to you alſo; that he that has ſealed you, may be a witneſſing Spirit to his own work; and that he would be the earneſt of your inheritance, a pledge of what God has further promiſed and purpoſed for you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Now he which ſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed you, is God. Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit into our hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) To ſpeak a little more <hi>particularly;</hi> what the Apoſtle prays for his <hi>Epheſians</hi> in more general Terms, he prays for the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> more particularly, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>We do not ceaſe to pray for you, and to deſire that you might be fill'd with the knowledge of his Will, in all Wiſdom, and Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work, and encreaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi> And when I have opened the particulars of this Scripture, I ſhall not need to ſeek elſewhere for an anſwer to this Inquiry, <hi>What is the matter of the fulneſs of God, which we ought to pray and ſtrive to be filled with?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. Let us pray and ſtrive, and ſtrive and pray again, adding endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>1</label> to prayers, and prayers to endeavours, <hi>that we may be filled with the knowledge of Gods will.</hi> And we have need to make this an eſſential part of our prayer; for firſt, We may happily do the will of God <hi>Materially,</hi> when we do it not <hi>Formally;</hi> not under that formal and preciſe conſideration, that what we do is the will of God, and that we do it under that conſideration becauſe it is the will of God. A Man may perhaps ſtumble upon ſome practices that are commanded by the Moral Law, and yet in all this not do Gods will but his own; that which in all our obedience we are to eye, and regard, is the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the will of God; we cannot be ſaid to obſerve a Commandment, unleſs we obſerve Gods Authority in that Commandment; nor to keep Gods Statutes, unleſs we keep God in our eye as the great Legiſlator and Statute maker: A blind obedience even to God is no more acceptable, than a blind obedience to Men is juſtifiable. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We ought to pray that we may be filled with the knowledge of Gods will, that there may be more employment for the powers and faculties of the Soul, which in every heart wherein the grace of God radically is, are in the general inclined to do the will of God: There are ſome well diſpoſed Chriſtians, of ſtrong affections and good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to do Gods will, who are but ſlenderly furniſht with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what that will of God is, which he would have them do: And thus thoſe warm propenſions of Spirit, either lye like dead ſtocks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hands, or elſe they laid out the zeal of their Souls upon that which is not the will of God; and when they have ſpent their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſtrength of Soul upon it, they come to God for a reward, who asks them, <hi>who required this at your hand?</hi> And thus even holy <hi>Davids</hi> zeal was miſlaid upon this account, that God had <hi>not ſpoken a
<pb facs="tcp:40119:71"/> word,</hi> nor revealed his will in the Caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.7. Thirdly, Its our great concern that we may know the will of God, and be <hi>filled with that knowledge;</hi> that the knowledge of Gods will may be an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative principle of obedience; thus <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, O God:</hi> We are to pray that God would teach us to know, and then teach us to do his will: knowledge without obedience is <hi>lame,</hi> obedience without knowledge is <hi>blind;</hi> and we muſt never hope for acceptance if we <hi>offer the blind and the lame to God,</hi> Luke 12.47. <hi>That Servant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes:</hi> As therefore all our practice muſt be guided by knowledge, ſo muſt all our knowledge be referred to practice. Fourthly, and laſtly, We ought to pray that we may be filled with the knowledge of God's will; that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being rooted and grounded in our Souls, it may render that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience eaſie and delightful, which is ſo neceſſary to its acceptation: when Satan had entred <hi>Judas</hi> his heart, he would not ſtick at any of the Devils commands; and when he had filled the heart of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> Acts 5.3. how ready were they to lie unto God? If our hearts were more filled with the knowledge of Gods will, that this Divine Law were written there, duty would be our delight, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our meat and drink; nor would there be room left for thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which hang upon us like dead weight, always incumbring us in our obedience.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>2</label> II. Let us pray again that we be <hi>filled with all wiſdom</hi> in the doing of the will of God; we want knowledge much, we want wiſdom more; we need more light into the will of God, and more judgment how to perform it. For firſt, It's one great inſtance of wiſdom, to know the ſeaſons of duty, and what every day calls for: As the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God diſpoſes us under various circumſtances, ſo it calls for the exerciſe of various duties; one circumſtance calls for mourning another for rejoycing; and yet neither ought our mourning to exclude a humble rejoycing in God; nor our rejoycing ſhut out a holy mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> are recorded as famous on this account, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.32. That they <hi>had underſtanding of the time, to know what</hi> Iſrael <hi>ought to do.</hi> And herein we are oftentimes at a great loſs, like thoſe children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.17. that complained of their fellows, they <hi>had piped unto them,</hi> and yet not been anſwer'd with <hi>dancing;</hi> that they <hi>had mourned to them, but they had not lamented.</hi> Holy Wiſdom would teach us to accommodate the preſent frame of our hearts to Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpenſations: Providence does not teach us new duties, but how to ſingle out thoſe that God has made our duties. Secondly, We need wiſdom that we be not deluded with ſhadows inſtead of ſubſtances, that we take not appearances for realities; for want of which, O how often are we cheated out of our intereſts, our real concerns, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of heart, and peace of Conſcience! We account him a weak and fooliſh Man who is impoſed upon, by Copper for Gold; that would warm his hands by painted fire, or hope to ſatisfie his craving
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40119:71"/> appetite with painted food; yet ſuch are we, who <hi>ſpend our mony for that which is not bread, and our labor for that which profits us not,</hi> Iſa. 55.2. who <hi>ſet our affections on thoſe things that are not,</hi> Prov. 23.5. Thirdly, Another point of wiſdom which we need to be inſtructed in, is the worth of Time, and what a weight of eternity depends on theſe ſhort and flitting moments; but we weak and ſilly ones count a day for no more than it ſtands for in the Calender; an hour no more than ſo much time meaſured by the hourglaſs; when one hour to repent in, a moment to make our Calling and Election ſure in, may come to be more worth than all the World can be to us. Fourthly, Wiſdom would teach us the due order and method of all things, what firſt, what laſt ought to be our ſtudy, and our concern; wiſdom would teach us <hi>to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs,</hi> Matth. 6.33. And then if there be time to ſpare, to beſtow ſome ſmall portion of it, for thoſe other things which God in his bounty will not deny, and in his wiſdom knows in what meaſure to beſtow. Fifthly, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would teach us the true worth and value of all things; to labour, pray, and ſtrive for them proportionable to their true intrinſick dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; to think that Heaven cannot be too dear, what-ever we pay for it; nor Hell cheap how eaſily ſoever we come by it; wiſdom would inſtruct us, that we cannot lay out too much of our time, ſtrength, contrivance upon Eternals, nor too little upon theſe periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temporals; that Earth deſerves very little of our Hand, leſs of our Head, and nothing at all of our Heart; little of our pains, leſs of our plotting, and leaſt of all of our love and affections.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Lets pray and ſtrive, ſtrive in the due and diligent uſe of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>3</label> means; and pray for a bleſſing upon them, that we may be <hi>filled with a ſpiritual underſtanding:</hi> A carnal heart will carnalize the moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mercies, and a carnal mind will debaſe the moſt ſpiritual Truths; the Manna was deſign'd to feed the Souls as well as the Bodies of the Jews; but <hi>they ate the ſpiritual meat, and drank the ſpiritual drink,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.</note> with very carnal Heads and Hearts; ſo that they needed the Spirit of God to inſtruct them in the right uſe of it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Thou gaveſt thy good Spirit to inſtruct them, and with-heldeſt not the Manna from their mouth.</hi> They might then have <hi>eaten their own condemnation</hi> as well as we under the Goſpel, by that Symbol; <hi>John</hi> 3.3. Chriſt had deliver'd a great and neceſſary Truth, <hi>except a Man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> but <hi>Nicodemus</hi> tho' a great Rabbi, turns it into a groſs and carnal interpretation: How <hi>can a Man be born when he is old? Can he enter the ſecond time into his Mothers womb and be born again?</hi> And at the ſame paſs were his rude and carnal hearers, <hi>John</hi> 6.51. <hi>I am the living bread</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>that came down from Heaven; if any Man eat of this bread he ſhall live for ever, and the bread that I will give is my fleſh that I will give for the life of the world;</hi> but his Capernatical hearers conceive of nothing but a literal, and oral Manducation of his natural fleſh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 52. <hi>The Jews therefore ſtrove among themſelves, ſaying, How can this Man give us his fleſh to eat?</hi> And yet Chriſt had
<pb facs="tcp:40119:72"/> ſaid enough to obviate that groſs miſtake, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Man hears the great Duties of the Goſpel preſſed upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and either ſitting down deſpondeth at the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or elſe undertakes them in his own ſtrength, and the power of his free will, not conſidering that there is Covenant grace to anſwer Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant duties, and Covenant pardon for thoſe imperfections that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them. Another perhaps hears the curſe thundred out againſt, <hi>Every one that continues not in all things written in the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. he hears that the primitive end of the Law was to juſtifie a righteous perſon that had perfectly obſerved it, and he falls upon the obſervation of that Law, as the condition of the Covenant of works, hoping to drudge out a righteouſneſs thereby, that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him blameleſs before God; not knowing, that <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. Let us therefore pray for a ſpiritual underſtanding, that <hi>we may know every Truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 4.21. that every line, every letter of the Old and New Teſtament has its center in a Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>4</label> IV. Let's pray again, and ſtrive that <hi>we may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing:</hi> knowing that all our ſervices, all our ſacrifices are nothing unleſs our God ſmell a ſweet ſavour in them: nor can we fill the ſails of our Souls with a more noble and generous ambition, than to be accepted of God. This was the height of the Apoſtles ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>We labour that whether preſent or abſent we may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him:</hi> which was the glorious frame of our bleſſed Saviours heart, <hi>John</hi> 8.29. That he <hi>always did the things that pleaſed</hi> his Father: Its a common deluſion of Profeſſors, that if they can get the work of their hands, not to regard whether ever it comes upon Gods heart or no: But what are our Prayers if God receives them not? Our Praiſes if God accepts them not? Our Obedience if God regards it not? Now that we may reach this great end, we <hi>muſt walk worthy of the Lord;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There ought to be a ſuitableneſs between the frame of our hearts, and the tenor of our converſations to this God whom we ſerve: If there be not that exact and punctual walking up to what God in ſtrict juſtice may expect, yet there muſt be that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and circumſpection which God in mercy will accept; we muſt be holy as the Lord our God is holy; Spiritual, becauſe we walk before him that is a Spirit: ſincere, as being always under his omniſcient Eye; acting our faith upon him that is faithful and true; caſting our care and burden upon him that has undertaken to care for us; and in all things proving what is the will of God, and then approving that will, and practiſing what we have thus approved.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>5</label> V. Let us pray and ſtrive; let's add holy endeavours to humble Prayers, and ſecond again thoſe endeavours with our Prayers, <hi>That we may be fruitful in every good work.</hi> That there may be Grace in the root, Grace in the fruit, Grace in the habit ſtrengthned, Grace in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40119:72"/> the exerciſe multiplyed. Let's pray that our Faith may not be a dead Faith, for want of the Grace of obedience; that our obedience be not a dead obedience, for want of a living Faith, and a lively, active Love; that our Fruit may be of the right kind, new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from a new heart; that it may be right for its proportion; for <hi>herein is our Father glorified, that we bring forth much fruit,</hi> John 15.8. that it be rightly directed; that we may bring forth fruit to God, and not to our ſelves: And to all our Prayers we muſt add this, that <hi>we may encreaſe in the knowledge of God:</hi> That knowing God better, we may love him better; and loving him more, we may ſerve and glorifie him more, and be riper every day for the enjoyment of him.</p>
               <p>And thus much in anſwer to the firſt Branch of the Queſtion: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Second.</p>
               <p>Second Branch of the Queſtion. <hi>What is the meaſure of that fulneſs of God, with which every true Chriſtian ought to pray, and ſtrive that he may be filled?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is <hi>Plenitudo fontis, &amp; Plenitudo Vaſis;</hi> the <hi>Fulneſs of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and the <hi>Fulneſs of the Veſſel.</hi> There is again <hi>Plenitudo Solis, &amp; Stellae;</hi> the <hi>fulneſs of Light in the Sun,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſs of Light in a Star.</hi> Again, there is <hi>Plenitudo Capitis, &amp; Membri,</hi> the <hi>Fulneſs of the Head,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſs of a Member:</hi> A Fountain is full; a Veſſel may be full, but with different meaſures: Jeſus Chriſt, as Head of the Church, has the <hi>Fulneſs of the Spirit without meaſure, John</hi> 3.34. A gracious Soul may be alſo full, but it is with the <hi>reſidue of the Spirit,</hi> which Chriſt can ſpare for the uſe of thoſe that are his, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>God is full of all Grace, with the fulneſs of the Fountain; he is <hi>full</hi> with his own fulneſs, but not <hi>filled</hi> from another. A Believer may be full too, but he is filled from the fulneſs of God. Thus <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> is ſaid to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. And ſo <hi>Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> v. 4. So was <hi>Zechariah,</hi> v. 67. And thus were the <hi>Diſciples all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 2.4. All theſe were full, but their fulneſs was borrowed; they were filled: It was <hi>of Chriſts fulneſs, that they received grace for grace,</hi> John 1.16. They were filled, but they could not fill others from thelr fulneſs; they had Grace, but none to ſpare: And every Believer muſt anſwer his Brother that would borrow of him, as the wiſe Virgins did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you.</hi> There is an All-ſufficiency of Grace in Chriſt; its well if Believers have a ſufficiency according to Chriſts promiſe to the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.19. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> And having premiſed this little, I ſhall give the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Anſwer to the Queſtion in theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Every gracious Soul ought to pray, and ſtrive to be filled with ſuch a meaſure of the fulneſs of God, and of his Grace, as the Holy Spirit, who is the proper Judge of that meaſure ſhall ſee fit to communicate to us.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:73"/>
               <p>The Holy Spirit has theſe parts in this matter. 1. He is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Worker of Grace. 2. He is the Diſtributer of all Grace. 3. He is the Arbitrator of that <hi>Quota,</hi> and proportion of Grace, which every Believer has need of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>All theſe worketh one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, dividing to every one ſeverally as he will;</hi> where you may obſerve the ſeveral parts that the Spirit of God hath in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 1. He works this Grace <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 'tis by his <hi>Energy,</hi> or powerful working that there is root or fruit, habit in us, or Act of Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from us. 2. He divides, and diſtributes to every one ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he is the great Steward of the Houſhold of Chriſt, and diſpenſes the meaſure of Grace to Individuals. 3. This meaſure is diſtributed by his abſolute power; 'tis <hi>according to his will,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as he pleaſes; for the Grace being his own, he may do with, and diſpoſe of his own Grace according to his own will: And tho' he will be faithful in the diſcharge of his truſt, yet will he be ſought unto to do it for us. Thus when there was a promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. that God would <hi>ſprinkle clean water upon his people, and cleanſe them from all their filthineſs, and from all their Idols:</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>That he would give them a new heart, and a new Spirit, and take away the Heart of ſtone, and give them a Heart of Fleſh, and put his Spirit within them</hi> v. 27. &amp;c. Yet ſtill, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>I will yet for all this be enquired of, by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Every gracious Soul ought to pray for ſuch a meaſure of Grace as may fit his Capacity; none are ſo full, but they may receive more: We have ſo little of Grace, becauſe we ask no more, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not:</hi> We are but poor in our ſelves, we might be enriched from Chriſt; and if we were more poor in Spirit, we ſhould be more enriched with Grace from him, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full:</hi> We ſhould not ſatisfie our ſelves with the preſent meaſure of Grace received: but pray, and ſtrive, that we may <hi>have grace given according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.7.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) We ought to pray and ſtrive that our narrow Veſſels may be widned, our Capacities enlarged that we may be more capable of Grace. The Veſſels of Divine Grace are of different ſizes; as <hi>one Star differs from another in glory,</hi> ſo one Saint differs from another in Grace. And as the Spirit enlarges the Heart, he will enlarge his own hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.10. <hi>I am the Lord even thy God, open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour may ſay to us, as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Ye are not ſtraitned in me, but ye are ſtraitned in your own Bowels:</hi> Our hearts are narrow towards Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, becauſe they are ſo enlarg'd towards earthly and viſible things; when <hi>the heart is enlarged as Hell, and death that cannot be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Hab. 2.5. For theſe periſhing things, no wonder if there be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room for the Graces of the Spirit. This is therefore our great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to pray, that God would enlarge our deſires, that he may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and fill them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:40119:73"/>(4.) We ought to pray and ſtrive, That all the Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the whole man may be filled according to their meaſures. There is much room in our Souls that is not furniſh'd; much waſte ground there that is not cultivated and improved to its utmoſt: We might have more light in the Underſtanding, more tractableneſs in the Will, more heat in our Love, and a ſharper edge ſet upon our Zeal: And we have warrant to pray for this meaſure of the fulneſs of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Now the God of peace ſanctifie you wholly, and I pray God your whole Spirit, Soul and Body may be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Every gracious Soul ought to pray and ſtrive for ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace, that he may be qualified for any Duty and Service that God ſhall call him to, and engage him in. The Hebrew word, which we render <hi>Conſecration,</hi> or <hi>ſeparation to an Office,</hi> is <hi>Filling the hand,</hi> Exod. 29.9. <hi>Conſecrate ye</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons,</hi> in the Hebrew, <hi>Fill the hand of</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons:</hi> Where God employs the hand, he will fill the hand; we have ground to believe that he will ſend us about no Errand, but he will bear our Charges; where-ever he gives a Commiſſion, he will beſtow a competent qualification; when we go about his Work, we may expect his preſence and aſſiſtance in the Work: And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems to ſtand upon theſe terms with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>If thy preſence go not with me, carry us not up hence:</hi> As therefore there is great variety of Duties in our Chriſtian Calling, we may in Faith expect, and from that believing expectation pray, that we may be furniſh'd with a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variety of Grace for the diſcharge of them.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Every true Chriſtian ought to pray &amp; ſtrive for ſuch a meaſure of Grace, as may enable him to bear patiently, chearfully and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, thoſe afflictions and ſufferings, which either God's good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhall lay upon us, or for his Names ſake we may draw upon our ſelves: We ought to pray, that either he will lay no more upon us than our preſent ſtrength can bear; or if he encreaſes our trials, he will encreaſe our Faith. There's no danger of exceſs in our Prayers, when we confine them to the limits of his gracious promiſes. Now here we have encouragement from his Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7.) Every true Chriſtian ought to pray and ſtrive for ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace, as may bring the Soul to a ſettlement and ſtability, that he be not ſoon ſhaken by the croſs and adverſe evils that he ſhall meet with in this Life.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> has gone before us in this Prayer, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, after that ye have ſuffered a while, make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſettle you.</hi> And herein eſpecially let us keep an eye upon theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">§ 1. Pray that God would ſo ſtabliſh you in the truth, that ye may not be blown away with every wind of Doctrin. A ſorry trivial

And this was the glory of <hi>Job</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. That <hi>tho' God ſhould ſlay him, yet would he truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Let us pray, and ſtrive that God would ſo ſettle and ſtabliſh us in Love to himſelf, that no blaſt of Afflictions from his hand may cool the fire of Divine Love in our hearts: We want exceedingly the Faith, that God carries on a deſign of Love under all his various and ſeemingly contrary dealings with us; he can love and correct; why then cannot we love a correcting God? Whether he wounds or heals, his love is the ſame, and why not ours? Can we not love God upon the ſecurity of Faith, that he will do us good, as well as upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that he has done us good?</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Pray we and ſtrive that God would ſo ſettle and ſtabliſh us in our inward peace, that no <hi>wind of temptation</hi> may overthrow it: 'Tis a ſlender and ill-made peace which every aſſault of the Tempter diſſolves.

               </p>
               <p>And thus I have return'd ſome Anſwer to the ſecond Branch of the Queſtion, What is the meaſure of the fulneſs of God with which every true Chriſtian ought to pray, and ſtrive to be filled?</p>
               <p>There will ſtill remain an enquiry, How we may reach to ſuch a meaſure of the Divine fulneſs as has been deſcribed? To which tho' the limits of this diſcourſe will not allow a full and juſt Anſwer, yet the importance of the Queſtion will oblige me to point at ſome few things, upon which your own Meditations may find matter of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:40119:74"/>1. And firſt it is neceſſary that we be convinced that we are very far ſhort of that fulneſs of God, which is attainable even in this life: Many might have had more grace, if they had not been under the deluſion that they had grace enough already: The dream of Perfection attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has prejudiced the perfection which is attainable: As <hi>Tully</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Multi ad ſapientiam perveniſſent, niſi eo jam ſe perveniſſe putaſſent:</hi> Many Men had arrived at a high degree of Wiſdom, had they not fondly conceited that they had already reacht the top of it: The Apoſtle's frame was moſt excellent and imitable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after it, that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He conſidered more what was before, than what he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; that is, he more lookt forward to what he had not yet attained, than backward to what he had.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us pray that we may know more of the Love of Chriſt to us, as the proper mean to be filled more with the fulneſs of God in us: This is the expedient of the Text; and what greater encouragement can there be, to love, ſerve, obey and glorifie our God, than that he has ſo freely, wonderfully loved us in Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us ſtrive to keep our veſſels pure and clean, tho' they be ſmall and narrow; that however they are of a narrow capacity, yet being pure and clean, God may delight to fill us, and to enlarge our hearts that we may receive more of his fulneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God:</hi> The ſight of God which a pure and holy heart qualifies us for, is the enjoyment of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gods communicating his love in its ſanctifying and ſaving effects; and ſo we ſhall find, if we compare <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God;</hi> with <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Except a Man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Labour to experience poverty of Spirit: The way to be rich in Grace, is to be poor in Spirit; which poverty of Spirit, does not conſiſt in having little Grace, but in a ſenſe that whatever we have little or much, its not of, or from our ſelves, but from the fulneſs of God.</p>
               <p>The more we empty our ſelves, (in that ſenſe) the more God will fill us, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.5. <hi>Every valley ſhall be filled:</hi> The humble valleys are often fruitful when the high hills are commonly barren: ſelf-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency diſcharges and diſobliges the all-ſufficiency of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.53. <hi>The rich he ſends empty away;</hi> Now as by the <hi>Rich</hi> we are here to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſuch as are rich in their own conceit, tho' they be really poor; ſo by the poor in Spirit we are to underſtand them that are convinced of their own original indigency, though by the Grace of God they are enriched, and their ſpiritual wants ſupplyed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.20.</p>
               <p>This poverty of Spirit, tho' it pretend not to merit, yet has a meetneſs for the fulneſs of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.25. <hi>I have ſatiated the weary Soul, and I have repleniſhed every ſorrowful Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb facs="tcp:40119:75"/>5. From this Spiritual poverty ariſes a Spiritul hunger and thirſt after more of the grace of God, which temper of Soul lies directly in the way of that promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs for they ſhall be filled:</hi> for 'tis <hi>upon him that is thirſty</hi> that God promiſes <hi>to pour out water;</hi> and 'tis <hi>the dry ground</hi> that God promiſes to ſatisfie <hi>with the floods,</hi> Iſa. 44.3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Attend in Conſcience, and Faith, with conſtancy and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, upon all the Ordinances of the New Teſtament; you read, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.12. of <hi>two olive branches, that through the two golden pipes, empty the golden oyl out of themſelves.</hi> Let the two Olive branches be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt in two Natures; the golden oyl will then be his precious Grace; and the golden pipes, the Ordinances of Chriſt, by which he empties out of himſelf that precious Grace, into holy, and clean, tho' earthen veſſels.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many other terms which the Ancients gave to the Lords Supper, they called it, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Perſons</hi> whom the Rich Man is here repreſented to deſire to <hi>come from Heaven or Hell,</hi> to give an Information to his <hi>Relatives</hi> how things go in thoſe unchangeable States of <hi>Happineſs</hi> or <hi>Miſery,</hi> are only brought in <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> upon ſuppoſition, or <hi>condition,</hi> granting it were ſo: Not that there is a ground for the expectation of any new Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from the other World; we may yield the thing poſſible, tho not probable; we are not to limit the Holy One who is moſt perfect; he is not bounded as to his Omnipotency, any more than his Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: He could, if he would, reveal himſelf now, as he did to <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Patmos</hi>
               <note n="11" place="margin">Rev. 1.9.</note>. He might, if he would, in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his Grace and Providence, uſe the <hi>Miniſtration of Angels</hi>

               <note n="13" place="margin">Job 33.12, 13</note>, and put them upon Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience extraordinarily; for thoſe Heavenly Spirits muſt be at his Service, in the affairs of his Kingdom<note n="14" place="margin">Rev. 22.9.</note>. Indeed the great inſtance of their Miniſtry was about the Perſon of Chriſt; yet he did uſe them afterwards to reveal his mind<note n="15" place="margin">Rev 1.1. —19.10.</note>. How far he is pleaſed to do it at this day in any rare inſtance, is not for me to determine: but ſome have pretended, to have Revelations from <hi>Angels,</hi> which have prov'd Deluſions. There is, it's true, a Miniſtry of them (in this <hi>Chapter</hi> where my <hi>Text</hi> is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) to carry holy Souls to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom, which is <hi>ordinary:</hi> But we will ſuppoſe there ſhould be any <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> yet that would not be any more (if ſo much) regarded than the <hi>ordinary</hi> means; and we ſhould <hi>through the Grace given,</hi> be careful <hi>not to be wiſe above that which is written</hi>

            <p n="2">II. The Second <hi>General</hi> is to ſhew, <hi>How, or upon what grounds the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means of Grace are more certainly ſuccefsful for Converſion, than if Perſons from Heaven or Hell ſhould tell us what is done there?</hi> as hath been explained.</p>

                  <hi>Epheſ. I. 19, 20.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>And what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Deſign of this Epiſtle is to ſet forth the Free-Grace of God in Man's Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">I. More generally, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By a particular enumeration of thoſe eternal Bleſſings which were decreed for us in Chriſt, <hi>viz. Election</hi> and <hi>Adoption,</hi> verſ. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Having thus looked ſo far back before the foundation of the World, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle ſets down what Chriſt did in time for us in his own Perſon, when he took our Nature upon him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Office of a Mediator, as our Head, compleating our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in himſelf by dying for us, <hi>in whom we have redemption through his Blood, the forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> verſ. 7. Then follow the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that we our ſelves, as Members of Chriſt, are Partakers of in this Life; and they are all comprehended in Faith, and in the certain conſequents of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> were called to this Faith by the preaching of the Goſpel, which (the Spirit of God accompanying it) became effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to beget Faith in them. <hi>Paul</hi> was mightily affected with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs the Goſpel had among the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> gives God thanks for it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. and prays heartily for a further encreaſe of that Faith in them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. and ſhews what a wonderful thing it is, that any are brought to believe in Jeſus; 'tis as great a Miracle as the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt from the Dead; that was an effect of Divine Power, and ſo is this.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:85"/>
            <p>I have made what haſt I could to bring down my Diſcourſe to the Text, and to the Point or Queſtion that I am deſired to ſpeak to this morning, <hi>viz. How it may convincingly appear that thoſe who think it an eaſie matter to believe, are deſtitute of ſaving Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſtating this Caſe, I ſhall do theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shew what a difficult thing it is to believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Give the reaſon why many Profeſſors count it an eaſie thing to believe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Prove that thoſe who count ſo, are deſtitute of ſaving Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Difficulty of Believing.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That which requires the greateſt-power and ſtrength to effect it, is no eaſie thing; but believing requires the greateſt power to effect it, therefore it is no eaſie thing to believe.</p>
            <p>I prove the Aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greateſt power in Heaven and Earth is required to raiſe up Faith in us.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Faith deals with the power of God only about thoſe things which it believes, bears it ſelf up upon that; and when God is about to perſwade a Sinner to believe his Free Grace, he firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces him of his power, that he is able to perform his promiſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God aſſerts his Power, he declares himſelf to be an Almighty God. So to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. and in the new Teſtament he often aſſerts his Power, that all thing are poſſible to him. Omnipotency ſticks at nothing, knows no difficulties; what cannot the exceeding greatneſs of his power do?</p>
            <p n="2">2. God doth exert and put forth his Power in ſome viſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification of it, that fully demonſtrates his Omnipotency, and can ſignifie nothing leſs; ſuch an inſtance we have in the Text, in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, this overt act Speaks out his infinite power, 'tis matter of fact and cannot be deny'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God gives the Saints ſome feeling and experience of the exceeding greatneſs of his power put forth in their own Souls, by working faith in them; they ſee 'tis the Lords doing that nothing in Man would ever lead him out to it, if God did not perſwade him, and bring over his heart to believe the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Believers under the new Teſtament though they hear much of the power of God ſet forth in the letter of the word, and though they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the efficacy of this power in their own hearts yet that which puts the matter quite out of doubt with them, is this undeniabl inſtance of divine power in the Reſurrection of Chriſt: <hi>Abraham</hi> wanted this, though he ſaw much of the power of God towards him, in calling him alone from his Fathers houſe, and greatly increaſing him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when he became two bands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. and in giving him a Son in his old age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the greateſt proof of Gods power to <hi>Abraham</hi> was the inward efficacy of it upon his own heart, that he ſhould be brought to believe a Reſurrection, when there was never any inſtance of ſuch a thing in the world before; 'tis a ſign he was
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40119:85"/> ſatisfied in the almighty power of God, accounted that God was able to raiſe him up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. though he received him from the dead in a figure; <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not really ſlain, therefore <hi>Abram</hi>'s Faith was more remarkable, that he ſhould believe that God could raiſe his Son from the Dead; and that he would do it, rather than break his promiſe, he reſolved to obey God for the preſent, and to truſt him for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: All that we believe now is but the conſequent of Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and follows upon it; the Head being riſen, the Members will alſo riſe, every one in his own order; not only by a bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at the laſt day, but by a Spiritual Reſurrection in their Souls here, when the time of their Converſion and Regeneration comes. That which convinces us of the Almighty Power of God to perform his Promiſes, is the Reſurrection of Chriſt; but that which was the chiefeſt proof of God's Power to <hi>Abram,</hi> was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impreſſion of it upon his Heart when he was firſt called.</p>
            <p>That he who as a Man had this Law written in his Heart, <hi>That he ſhould not kill,</hi> ſhould ſo readily yield to the killing of his Son; and when he was reſolved ſo do, had the Knife in his hand ready ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, was under the higheſt impulſe of Faith to do what God commanded him; that he ſhould preſently be taken off from it by a counter-command from Heaven: How did God try <hi>Abram,</hi> as if he had ſet himſelf to puzzle him; turns him and winds him this way and that way, backward and forward; he muſt not kill, and then he muſt kill; and by and by he muſt not kill; God was reſolved his Faith ſhould move as he would have it, according to his Will; and <hi>Abram</hi> was as ready to comply, <hi>He is my God,</hi> ſays <hi>Abram, and I will obey him; Iſaac</hi> ſhall die, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall live; what God will: He ſees further than I do, I'll follow him, though I know not whether I go, nor what I do; God knows, that's enough for me, I'll truſt him; Lord, what wilt thou have me do? tell me, and I'll do it; ſhall I kill my Son, or ſhall I ſpare my Son? it ſhall be as thou wilt, Lord.— Herein <hi>Abram</hi> excelled all Believers under the New Teſtament: though they have ſome experience of God's Power put forth upon their Souls in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet they don't bear only upon this as <hi>Abram</hi> did; they have the Reſurrection of Chriſt to ſupport their Faith, which <hi>Abram</hi> had not, and yet believes a Reſurrection Power as firmly as they who ſaw Chriſt riſen from the Grave: God appeared to <hi>Abram,</hi> and made ſuch immediate Impreſſions of his Power upon his Heart, that he needs no Sign, no viſible Inſtance to confirm his Faith, he was ſatisfy'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; he ſaw that in God himſelf, that made him never to diſpute his Power afterwards.</p>
            <p>Saints now, though they have experience of a Divine Power touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hearts, and drawing them to Chriſt, yet they cannot ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern this conquering ſubduing Power of God in themſelves, as they may in Chriſt their Head, becauſe they are under many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not yet removed; they don't ſee Sin and Death, and the Devil and the World quite overcome in themſelves, but they ſee all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:40119:86"/> in Chriſt; his Reſurrection proves all; and they are fain often to reflect upon that, to ſtrengthen their Faith and Aſſurance of Victory in their own perſons at laſt; they know that Chriſt did not die for himſelf, nor riſe for himſelf, but for them; they ſee Chriſt crowned with Glory and Honour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. he ſuffers no more in his Perſon, though he ſtill ſuffers in his Members; but they ſhall e're long be as free from Suffering, as the glorified Perſon of Chriſt now is in Heaven; thus it will be when Chriſt myſtical ſhall have all things put under his Feet; then Chriſt and his Saints will reign gloriouſly to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, all tears ſhall be wiped from their eyes then, and this will as ſurely come to paſs as Chriſt himſelf is riſen from the Dead. Be of good cheer, I have overcome the World, I have, and you ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; in me you already are more than Conquerors, and in your own Perſons you ſhall be, when I come again.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Becauſe no natural Principle in Man can take in the objects of Faith, Fleſh and Blood can't reveal them to us; Faith is an act above Reaſon; how is it poſſible for a Man, as a Man, to act above his Reaſon? 'tis abſurd and irrational to think ſo; Goſpel-truths are ſo deep and myſterious, that they do tranſcend our humane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and cannot be diſcern'd but by the light of a Divine Faith: What is humane, we may undertake, and count that eaſie to us; but what is Divine is above us, quite out of our reach; therefore Faith is ſaid to be the work of God, fulfilled by his Power, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.11. The knowledge of Faith, by which we are perſwaded of that which we conceive not, is higher than all rational underſtanding; we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of that, as Chriſtians, which as Men we do not Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifically know by any Logical Demonſtration: Faith gives us the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of thoſe things which we comprehend not.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That which makes believing ſo difficult, is the ſeeming contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory acts of Faith, it ſeems not to conſiſt with it ſelf. Here I take Faith more generally, as it has for its Object the whole Word of God, the Law and the Goſpel, the ſpecial Object of Faith, as Saving, is the Promiſe; Saving Faith ſeeks Life which is not to be found in Commandments and Threats, but in a Promiſe of Mercy. Faith acting upon the whole Word of God, ſeems to contradict it ſelf; for Faith believes a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is to die according to the Law, and that he ſhall live, according to the Goſpel; Faith has the Word of God for both, both for the Death and Life of a Sinner, and both are true; the Law muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and the Promiſe muſt be performed; but how to reconcile this is not ſo obvious and eaſie to every one: Is the Law then againſt the Promiſes of God? God forbid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. 'tis impoſſible both ſhould be accompliſhed in the Perſon of a Sinner; he cannot die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and live eternally, yet both are wonderfully brought about by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the manifold Wiſdom of God, without any Derogation to his Law and Juſtice; God and his Law are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, and the Promiſe of Salvation made good to the Sinner, and ſo both Law and Goſpel have their ends; not a tittle of either falls to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40119:86"/> the ground, Heaven and Earth may ſooner paſs away, than this can be. O what a miſtery is Chriſt! Fleſh and blood can't reveal this to us, every believer aſſents to the truth of the Law as well as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; he knows that both muſt have their full courſe, the Law is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in inflicting Death, the Goſpel in giving Life; the Law contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes nothing to the eternal Life of a ſinner, but kills him and leaves him weltering in his blood; is no more concerned about him for ever; if God will bring this dead ſinner to life again, he may diſpoſe of him as he pleaſe, the Law has done its utmoſt againſt him; ſo the Law did againſt Chriſt, ſpared him not, but killed him out-right, and left him for a time under the power of Death; but having ſlain a Man, who was God as well as Man, Death was too weak to hold him, he ſwallows up Death in victory; he whom the Law ſlew as Man, riſes as God, by the power of his godhead; the Law contributed nothing to his Reſurrection; the Law had the chief hand in his Death, but none in his Reſurrection: And here begins our eternal Life, in the Reſurrection of him who dies no more, and is the Reſurrection and Life to all who believe in him.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The reigning unbelief that is among the generality of Men, even among thoſe who are of greateſt reputation for Wiſdom and Learning; Ay, and among thoſe who carry the vogue for Zeal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are counted the Head and Pillars of the Church: Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Infallibility, others ſet up themſelves and are cryed up by many, as ſuch competent Judges in all matters of Faith, that their judgment is not to be queſtioned, but readily complied with by all who would not be counted ſingular and Schiſmatical. So 'twas in our Saviours time, the Jews who had been the only Profeſſors of the true Religion for many ages, in oppoſition to all Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, they ſtumble at the Goſpel: the Greeks who were the more Learned ſort of the Heathen World, they counted it fooliſhneſs. And thus was the whole World ſet againſt Chriſt, here was the greateſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hinderance of the belief of the Goſpel that could be imagined; and add to this the indefatigable pains and induſtry of the Devil to keep out the light of the Goſpel from ſhining in upon us; he blinds the Eyes of Men by a curſed influence upon their corrupt minds, that they ſhould not believe: Is it not a hard matter under all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to embrace the Goſpel, and declare our belief of it? <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believed on him? But this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who know not the Law,</hi> John 7.48, 49. Why ſhould any regard what a company of poor illiterate people do? Their following Chriſt is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an argument why we ſhould not follow him, they are all but fools and ideots that do ſo; A curſed ſort of people. This is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Men of the World have of believers. There is nothing among too many ſelf-conceited Scepticks lies under a greater impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of folly and madneſs, than faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: O what a paſs are things come too, that after ſo many hundred years profeſſion of Chriſtianity, we ſhould grow weary of Chriſt and the Goſpel!</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:87"/>V. The notorious Apoſtacy of many Profeſſors this day, who have made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. may convince you all that 'tis no eaſie matter to believe; ſo to believe as to perſevere in the Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Believers themſelves find it a difficult matter to act their Faith; if their Lives lie upon it, they cannot act it at their pleaſure, without the ſpecial aid and aſſiſtance of the Spirit; 'tis God muſt work in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Believers are hardly put to it, great is the labour and travel of their Souls in believing, they meet with much oppoſition from fleſh and blood in every act of Faith they put forth; they are forced to cry out for help in the midſt of an act of Faith, leſt they ſhould fail in it. <hi>I helieve, Lord help my unbelief, q. d.</hi> I am now under ſome light and power of Faith, but I ſee I can't hold it, if thou doſt not help me. I feel fleſh and blood riſing up againſt my Faith, I begin to ſtagger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, Lord help me that I may not be run down by my carnal Heart. Temptations ſhake our Faith many times; there is a perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict between Faith and Diffidence, yet Faith fails not utterly, there 'tis ſtill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22, 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.6, 9. Faith upholds the Heart ſtill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. Unbelievers they tremble and turn away from God, but true believers in their greateſt frights and fears, do run to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.3. make towards him ſtill. Were it an eaſie matter to believe, ſuch ſuddain fits of unbelief would not come ſo ſtrongly upon belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reſon why many Profeſſors count it an eaſie thing to Believe.</p>
            <p>The main Reaſon is this, and I will inſiſt upon no other, <hi>viz. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they miſtake a formal Profeſſion of Faith, for real believing;</hi> this undo's thouſands, who becauſe they are qualified as National Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, for all worldly preferments, here they reſt, and make no other uſe of their Religion, as if the Articles of their Faith obliged them to nothing. A formal Profeſſion is general, takes up Religion in groſs, but is not concerned in any one point of it. But real Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is particular, brings down every Goſpel Truth to our ſelves, ſhews us our concernments in it: <hi>Save thy ſelf,</hi> ſaith Faith, <hi>and work out thy own Salvation, ſee you neglect it no longer;</hi> no Man can ſave ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans Soul by his Faith, his own he may; Faith buſies it ſelf about our own Salvation, ſhews us what we muſt do to be ſaved; were there more of this Faith among Profeſſors, we ſhould every one have work enough upon our hands, and not find it ſo eaſie a matter to ſecure our Souls into eternity. General Profeſſors carry it as if they had nothing to do, were ſure of Heaven already; at this rate we may count it an eaſie matter to believe, but when we come to die we ſhall not find it ſo: any Faith may ſerve ſome Mens turns to live by, but every Faith will not ſerve our turns to die by; when we are dying in good earneſt, a feigned Faith ſignifies little to our comfort, we ſee thorow it, and ſink under it.</p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:40119:87"/>
            <p>If your Faith do not often call upon you to look to your own Souls, it cannot be ſaving Faith; he that ſeeks not to ſave himſelf, let him talk what he will of his Faith, it is not ſaving Faith, that is, intent upon the ſalvation of a believer, and finds enough to do in carrying on that work, with fear and trembling leſt it ſhould not go thorow with it. You who have been at this work in good earneſt, don't find it ſo eaſie as ſome would make it; new doubts, new difficulties, new temptations do ariſe every day, that put the Faith of the beſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to it; if Faith do's not beſtir it ſelf, the Devil may be too hard for you and your Faith too; if the righteous are ſcarcely ſaved, ſurely 'tis no eaſie matter to get to Heaven; you muſt run, wreſtle, ſtrive, fight, contend earneſtly, elſe you may miſs of Heaven, and come ſhort of all your expectation of eternal glory: I ſpeak not this to diſcourage you, but to awaken you to that diligence and care that ſo weighty a buſineſs calls for.</p>
            <p>Saving Faith is to caſt my Self and my own Soul upon Chriſt for ſalvation; what ever your Faith may be 'tis not come to ſaving Faith, till you do this you may carry all your knowledge and all your Faith to Hell with you; any Faith that is not ſaving, but remains ſeparate from it, will prove a damning Faith to you; 'twill greatly aggravate your condemnation, that you who knew ſuch things, believed ſuch things, aſſented to ſuch Truths and Goſpel Doctrins, ſhould never put forth an act of ſaving Faith for your own Souls in particular, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the import of thoſe Doctrins; 'tis ſtrange to ſee how many Profeſſors do leave themſelves quite out of their own Faith; they will not be at the pains to act it for themſelves, but in general they believe as the Church believes; but let me tell you, 'tis not the Church, nor all the Churches in the World, 'tis not all the Angels in Heaven, nor all the Saints upon Earth can believe for you; you muſt every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for your ſelves, and act your own buſineſs, caſt your own Souls upon Chriſt for Salvation elſe they will be eternally loſt: How many knowing hiſtorical Believers are there in Hell, who have Propheſied in his Name, Prayed in his Name, have Written, Diſputed, Argued ſtrongly for the Faith, have done every thing that belongs to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, but could never be brought to put forth one act of ſaving Faith upon Chriſt for the Salvation of their own Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary, &amp;c.</hi> is this done? till you perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally come to Chriſt for the pardon of your ſins, and for the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your perſons by name, <hi>John, Thomas, Mary,</hi> whatever your names are, he or ſhe, I am ſent this day to give you a particular call to come to Chriſt; and I do warn every one of you, and exhort every one to go to Chriſt by a perſonal act of your own Faith for eternal life; he has purchaſed it for all who come unto him, if you neglect it and will not go, your blood be upon your own heads, I have delivered my own Soul.</p>
            <p>Brethren be perſwaded to hearken to the invitation that is given you in the Goſpel, before it be too late. O what a do is there to bring a
<pb facs="tcp:40119:88"/> ſinner to Chriſt! O that you would bethink your ſelves this day, and ſet about ſaving Faith! act that Faith that will ſave you; and ſay, Lord, after all my Knowledge and long Profeſſion, after all my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, Reading, I now ſee theſe are but means in order to ſomething elſe, the end of all is real believing in Chriſt; and I am now at laſt come to do that, to commit my ſelf wholly to Chriſt, to caſt my ſinful Soul upon him for Righteouſneſs and Life; Lord help me to do this, bring me to a through reliance upon Chriſt, and keep me in the frequent exerciſe and lively actings of this Faith every day, that I may ſee my ſelf ſafe in him, who is faithful, and will keep that which I ſo commit unto him. The Juſt ſhall live by his own Faith which he acts for himſelf and for his own Soul; if you do not thus commit your ſelves to Chriſt every day, by a renewed act of Faith, you may loſe the joy of your Salvation ere you are aware.</p>
            <p>If you ſay this is done, I will not ask you when you did it firſt? that may ſeem too nice a queſtion to ſome, but I will ask you when you did it laſt? I hope you do it every day, if you are at any ſtand in your thoughts about this, your wiſeſt courſe is to act over this ſaving Faith more diſtinctly, more particularly, more frequently, for the Salvation of your own Soul; then your Faces will ſhine, and your Hearts will rejoyce, we ſhall know you have been with Jeſus.</p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible to experience the power and efficacy of ſaving Faith till we act it in our own caſe, for our own Souls; then it comes home indeed to our ſelves, then we feel the comfort of it; we may own the general Doctrin of Faith, and be little affected with it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about it; but when the Grace of Faith comes and makes a particular application of that Doctrin to thy Soul, and my Soul, then we believe for our ſelves, and are filled with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, that we ſhould be received unto mercy, have all our ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, our perſons accepted, and our Souls eternally ſaved; all this Faith makes out to us by name, from ſuch undeniable grounds and reaſons, that we cannot gainſay.</p>
            <p>They count it eaſie to believe who ſhut all acts of ſelf-denial quite out of their Faith; they live as they did before, it may be walk on more ſecurely in their evil courſes, from a preſumptuous perſwaſion of mercy at laſt; pray God deliver us from ſuch a Faith that gives encouragement to ſin: If your Faith do not ſtrongly incline you to a holy Life, you may be ſure 'tis not right ſaving Faith. 'Tis a ſad thing to conſider how little influence the Faith of ſome confident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors has upon their Lives; they are not, they will not be governed by the Faith which they profeſs; the Devil allows of ſuch a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and 'tis all the Religion he will admit of in his followers; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they don't touch upon the power of godlineſs, all forms are alike to him; and in ſome caſes the pureſt and moſt Scriptural ſerve his turn beſt, when ſeparated from the power of godlineſs, then he has ſome Scripture on his ſide, to perſwade them that all is well; then he cries, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are ye;</hi> ſetled in a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40119:88"/> Church way, according to all the Rules of Diſcipline laid down in the Word; and is not this Religion enough to ſave you? Thus the Devil will ſometimes give the beſt form its due commendation from Scripture, when it may ſerve as an Argument to perſwade a formal Chriſtian to ſit down ſhort of the power of Godlineſs; he knows God's own form will not ſave us then, though he would make them believe otherwiſe: He put the Jews upon pleading this, and poſſeſſed them that all was well, while they held to the outward form of Worſhip that God had appointed, which made the Lord himſelf ſo often to declare againſt them; and the outward forms of Worſhip that he had appointed, becauſe he ſaw they reſted in them, and played the Hypocrites under them. Let us have a care in theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-times, that we do not reſt in Goſpel-forms only, placing the whole of our Religion in that which God has made but a part of it; and ſuch a part, that ſhould never be divided by us, from the Power and Spirit of the Goſpel. We talk of damnable Hereſies, and there are ſuch, the Lord keep us from them; but let me tell you, you may paſs (though more ſilently) into Hell through a formal Profeſſion of the Truth, and have your porticn with Hypocrites, who profeſs'd what you do, had the ſame form of Godlineſs that you have, but deny'd the power of it: I don't ſay as ſome of you do, I hope otherwiſe of you all; but let every one examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what powerful Influence thoſe Goſpel-truths have upon him, which he has lived ſo long under the profeſſion of; you know this beſt, and others may more than gueſs at it, by your Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; but I ſpare you, having laid my finger upon the ſoar place, I take it off again, and leave every one to his own feeling.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>You ſeem as if you would put us off from our Profeſſion.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be, better off than on in ſome reſpects; but my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is to bring you up to your Profeſſion, that you may be real in it, and not mock the Lord, nor deceive your ſelves: I have often thought that he who makes a ſolemn Profeſſion of his Faith, and ſays, <hi>I believe in God, and in Chriſt,</hi> had need conſider well what he ſays, leſt he lie unto the Holy Ghoſt; though what you profeſs be truth, yet your Profeſſion may be a Lie, if you ſay you believe what you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; with the Mouth Confeſſion is made, but with the Heart Man believes; believing is Heart-work, which the Searcher of Hearts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can judge of; therefore you ſhould conſult your Hearts, whether you do indeed believe, before you tell God and Man that you do; 'tis a ſad thing, that the frequeut repetition of our Creed, and the renewed Profeſſion we make of our Faith, ſhould be charged upon us as ſo many groſs Lies, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36, 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They who count it an eaſie matter to believe, are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtute of Saving Faith.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:89"/>
            <p>I prove it thus,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They who have never found any Conflict in themſelves about believing, are deſtitute of ſaving Faith.</p>
            <p>But they who count it an eaſie matter to believe, have never found any Conflict in themſelves about believing, <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Faith did not act in oppoſition to carnal Reaſon, and carry it againſt all the ſtrong reaſonings of the Fleſh to the contrary; Supernatural Truths, which never enter, never be admitted, never find acceptance in the Soul, we ſhould never be brought over to aſſent to them, ſo as to make them the ſure ground of our truſt and confidence in God; but Faith captivates all rebellious thoughts, that exalt themſelves againſt the knowledge of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> as if they could diſprove all that the Goſpel ſays; but the demonſtrations of the Spirit are with that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that we cannot reſiſt them: Chriſt teaches, as one having Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; beſides the inſtructive evidence of Truth in clear reaſonings, and full demonſtrations of it by the Spirit, there is Authority and Power to back all this; ſo that having nothing to object that is and fully anſwered, we dare not but obey, becauſe of his Authority leſh Power over us; were it not for this Authority and Power proud F the would pertinaciouſly ſtand out againſt all the Reaſonings of the Spirit; but when the <hi>Rationale</hi> of the Goſpel is made out by art Spirit beyond all contradiction from Fleſh and Blood, the carnal p et is nonpluſt and ſilenced, cannot ſpeak ſenſe againſt the Goſpel; y e however, 'twill be muttering and kicking againſt the Truth; her comes in the Authoritative Act and Power of the Spirit, ſuppreſſing the inſolence of the Fleſh, and commanding the Soul in the Name of God to obey, and not ſtand it out any longer againſt ſuch clear evidence, reſiſting the Wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt. You muſt know that Fleſh and Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> that carnal corrupt part that is in every Man is never convinced, 'tis not capable of any ſuch thing; but the Power of the Spirit of God brings on a Conviction upon the Soul from a higher Light, notwithſtanding all that the Wiſdom of the Fleſh can ſay to the contrary: Fleſh is Fleſh ſtill in all choſe who are born of the Spirit, but 'tis overpower'd and kept under by the ſtronger reaſonings of the Spirit, which is the cauſe of that continual Conflict that is between the Fleſh and Spirit, to talk of eaſie believing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſiſtance from our own corrupt minds, is to talk of that that never was, nor can be in any man whatever; Saints are inclined two contrary ways; though one Principle be predominant, yet the other is not extinct, has not yet loſt all its power; 'twill ſtir, and fight, and reſiſt, though it can't overcome, and Faith it ſelf feels the ſtruglings of unbelief, and bears up with more Courage againſt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They who were never convinced of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and of the dreadfulneſs of God's Wrath againſt Sinners, are deſtitute of Saving Faith, but they who count it an eaſie matter, <hi>&amp;c. ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't mean that all muſt paſs under the like terrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; ſome have a more eaſie paſſage from a ſtate of Nature to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40119:89"/> Grace, from Death to Life, from Terror to Comfort; they may ſooner get over their Tears, and attain to peace, than others may. But this I ſay, that all who have fled for refuge unto Chriſt, are ſenſible of this, that they have eſcaped eternal Death, are delivered from the wrath of God, they remain under this conviction; and it adds much to their comfort, that they have eſcaped ſo great danger, and glad they are to ſee themſelves ſafe under the Wing of Chriſt; they live in a conſtant admiration of the goodneſs of God to them, in bringing about ſo great Salvation for them, who had no might nor power to do any thing for themſelves; it was not their own Arm that ſaved them; they who know not the Nature of ſin, may think it an eaſie matter to be ſaved; ſlight wounds are eaſily cured, but old putrified Sores require more Sovereign Remedies, and good skill to apply them. Sin is an old Sore, they who know the plague of their own Hearts do count it ſo; 'tis more than a cut Finger, it has infected the very Vitals, and will prove mortal; if the Blood of Chriſt be not applyed as the only remedy in that caſe, nothing elſe will do. Slight thoughts of ſin is the cauſe of all that neglect and contempt of Chriſt that is in the World; <hi>the whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick;</hi> 'tis a fatal Symptom when the Brain is affected, and the Senſes taken away; when the malignity of ſin has quite ſtupify'd the Conſcience, and wrought a numneſs and mortification, there is little hope of ſuch a one; and thus it is with too too many hardned, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſenſleſs Sinners, who think themſelves ſafe, though they are at the brink of deſtruction; they bleſs themſelves, and cry, <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> when the Curſe of God lies upon them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe who have never been tempted to unbelief, are deſtitute of Saving Faith: but thoſe who count it an eaſie matter to believe, were never ſenſible of any temptation to unbelief. No man ever got over temptations to unbelief without difficulty; unbelief has much to ſay for its ſelf, and 'twill be ſure to ſay all it can to hinder the Soul from cloſing in with Chriſt: When we come to ſet our Faith againſt all the ſtrong Reaſons that Fleſh and Blood urges to the contrary; then tell me whether it be an eaſie matter to believe? here comes in all the trouble the Saints meet with in their way to Heaven; the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Faith diſcourages them, and lets in the ſtrength of the Enemy upon them; they overcome the World by Faith, but if that fail, every thing is too hard for them; they ſtumble at every ſtraw, who before could remove Mountains, and make nothing of 'em; all things are poſſible to him who believes, and every thing is next to impoſſible to him who believes not, is clouded and darkned in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his Faith, is not under the clear evidence of things not ſeen; he muſt have good eyes who diſcerns things that are not ſeen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He who is not much in Prayer, much in the uſe of all means to increaſe and ſtrengthen his Faith, is deſtitute of ſaving Faith; but he who counts it an eaſie matter to believe, takes no pains this way, he can believe at any time; then thou canſt do that that Fleſh and
<pb facs="tcp:40119:90"/> Blood never did, that no mortal man ever did in his own ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He who does not look upon a Life of Faith to be a careful, ſtudious, laborious Life, is deſtitute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith hath new rules, counſels, and methods of living, that a man was never acquainted with before; he meets with many ſcruples, doubts, and intricate caſes, that put him to it, to find out the right way of pleaſing God; for that is the great deſign of Faith to walk before God unto all well-pleaſing; Faith lives in a continual fear of offending God, is very circumſpect &amp; watchful, leſt it ſhould take a wrong ſtep: The Saints are buſied much in building up themſelves on their moſt holy Faith, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. they know all will run to ruine, if the ſpiritual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be neglected; it muſt be often viewed; we muſt ſee what is lacking in our Faith, what repairs are neceſſary; care muſt be taken that we fall not from our own ſtedfaſtneſs; when we begin to yield to a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to move never ſo little from any point of truth formerly received, we may be quickly beſide the foundation; therefore be unmoveable from the hope of the Goſpel; when once you begin to move from Chriſt, you know not whether you may be carried, as the <hi>Galatians</hi> were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. all this ſhews what a careful laborious Life a Life of Faith is.</p>

               </label> Theſe may be convincing Reaſons to others, <hi>That thoſe who count it an eaſie matter to believe, are deſtitute of ſaving Faith: But how ſhall we faſten a conviction of unbelief upon the perſons themſelves, who count it an eaſie matter?</hi>

               </label> Tho' we may not convince them, yet we may lay convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before them, that ſome time or other an awakened Conſcience may take notice of, and urge upon them, eſpecially when they are not under any preſent urgent temptation to unbelief; a Man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of a Sin before the temptation, and yet caſt off all his Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under a Temptation, becauſe Conſcience is more diſpos'd to judge impartially of the matter, when 'tis not byaſſed by any preſent Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary, as <hi>Hazael, What is thy Servant a Dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.13. Do you count me ſuch a Villain, ſuch a Wretch! and yet in an hour of temptation he acted over all that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Tho men may throw off all, and turn away from the light of their own Conſciences; yet 'tis good to furniſh Conſcience with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before-hand, that may be produced in a fit ſeaſon; if not to the conviction, yet to the ſilencing of thoſe who talked ſo faſt before againſt all they were charged with; tho you cannot convince a Man of this or that ſin that you know he is guilty of, yet 'tis good to charge him home, and to lay convincing Arguments before him, that may be of great uſe when Conſcience is at leiſure to conſider them, as it may be, and will be when the temptation is ended. And let me add this, I do conceive it poſſible even by reaſon to convince a Man of his unbelief, tho not of the ſin of unbelief; that is a further work, a ſpecial work of the Spirit. But you may by reaſon convince a Man of unbelief; whether he do well or ill in not believing, that's another caſe; but that ſo it is, that he does not believe ſuch convincing evidences of this may be laid before him, that he cannot but own himſelf to be an Unbeliever. I don't ſpeak now of negative Infidelity among Pagans, who never heard of the light
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40119:90"/> of the Goſpel, this needs no proof; Heathens do own their infidelity, they openly profeſs it: but I ſpeak of poſitive wilful unbelief, in thoſe who live under Goſpel light, and under an outward profeſſion of Faith too, yet really do not believe; they ſay they have Faith, but have it not: How to find out ſuch Men, and to convince them of their unbelief; How to dig up this Fox that is ſo deeply earthed under a ſpecious profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith; This requires ſome skill, we ſhall find it difficult work, yet I conceive it may be done; they may be ſo narrowed up, that unleſs they deny their ſenſe and their reaſon, they muſt own their unbelief.</p>
            <p>Though we cannot by reaſon bring Men to believe, yet we may by reaſon convince them of their unbelief; here we offer nothing new or ſurprizing to them, we only ſtate the matter as it is in their own Hearts, which they know to be ſo; we do but bring them to reaſon, to their own reaſon; we make them Judges of themſelves in a matter of fact, of their own doing; though they ſay they have Faith; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe put to it, they muſt needs unſay that again; the evidence of the thing it ſelf overthrows all they can ſay againſt it.</p>
            <p>I would argue thus with them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let them if they can produce any of thoſe fruits and effects of Faith that are inſeparable from it, <hi>James</hi> 2.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To pretend to ſuch an active principle as Faith is, and yet do nothing by it, is very unreaſonable; they ſay they have Faith, they may as well ſay they have Wings and can fly, though they cannot bare up themſelves one inch from the ground, unleſs ſome part of the body reſt upon it; indeed if a Mans feet be upon the ground, all the other parts of the body may be erect; but for the whole body to carry all its weight upwards through the Air, this is flying: 'Tis equally abſurd for Men to ſay they have Faith, are riſen with Chriſt, are in an aſcending poſture, when they viſibly reſt upon the Earth; nay, when they lie flat upon it, are ſunk into it, covered all over with it, are as it were buried alive in their carnal affections: Men may ſay what they will, 'tis apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly otherwiſe: upwards and downwards cannot be ſo confounded, that one ſhould be taken for tother, 'tis againſt common ſenſe; Men may and muſt be convinced of this, that what is contrary to Faith is not Faith, <hi>Faith without works is dead;</hi> were there any thing of the true Nature, Life and Spirit of Faith in them, they could not carry it as they do.</p>
            <p>They make Faith an eaſie thing who make juſt nothing of it, and do nothing by it; nay, they do that which they might with far more colour of reaſon do, if they did not at all pretend to Faith; but to ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and yet act in a direct oppoſition to him, and to their own Faith alſo, is that which no Man in his wits will give credit too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them try their skill in thoſe indiſpenſible acts of Faith that Chriſt requires in all his followers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24, 25. The reading of thoſe words is enough to convince any conſidering Man, that 'tis no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believe; that which is not eaſie to do, is not ſo eaſily believed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let them conſider the miſterious points of Faith, that are above our reaſon and do tranſcend our humane capacities, as the Doctrin
<pb facs="tcp:40119:91"/> of the Trinity, of the incarnation of Chriſt, of the Reſurrection, of Juſtification by imputed Righteouſneſs; how have Men ſtumbled at theſe things? could never come to any ſatisfaction in, by their own reaſon? and ſhall we ſay 'tis an eaſie matter to believe theſe things? they are ſtupidly ignorant of the miſteries of Faith who ſay ſo; if this be eaſie there is nothing hard or difficult in the World.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>How comes it to paſs that any do believe?</hi>

O the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe!</hi> This is the undoubted experience of every true Believer. You who know not how you came by your Faith, but ſlid into it by cuſtom, education, and long continuance under the means of Grace, and have always counted it an eaſie thing to believe; let me tell you, you know not what it is to believe, to this day. 'Tis true God makes it eaſie to believe, but ſo that we ſtill ſee it impoſſible to believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his help. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me: I live, yet not I:</hi> We may ſoar aloft when upon Eagles wings; we may move any where as we are carried; but all this while we know we are not the cauſe of our own motion; the Spring of it is not in our ſelves, <hi>acti agimus,</hi> we act as we are acted; the root bears us, not we the root; we feel Chriſt living in us; <hi>We live, becauſe he lives in us.</hi> What we receive from another, is ours when we receive it; but 'tis not from our ſelves becauſe we receive it from another: God makes us ſo to work, in ſuch a dependance upon him, that we ſee 'tis <hi>He that worketh in us both to will and to do:</hi> To aſcribe the free acts of own will to another, requires a humble mind ſenſible of its own weakneſs, and of the ſecret ways of Gods divine communications to his creature Man, exactly ſuted to the rational nature of ſo free an agent as Man is; the freedom of whoſe will is preſerved under a conſtant depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon God in every thing he do's: God that gave him this freedom, can cauſe him freely to act it as he pleaſes; otherwiſe Man would not be a governable creature, if the natural freedom of his will did exempt him from a due ſubjection to God that made him; in which ſubjection he is as free, as he could be ſuppoſed to be, if left to himſelf to do what he liſt: A Believer liſts and wills what he do's, and yet he do's not do what he liſts, but freely ſubjects his own will to the will of God, <hi>whoſe ſervice is perfect freedom.</hi> A Saint keeps up the liberty of his will, by a voluntary obedience to the will of God, and this is his Grace; till our ſtubborn Hearts are brought to this, they are, and will be rebellious againſt God.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid may be convincing to theſe eaſie Believers, that they are void of true ſaving Faith, unleſs they reſolve not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; and though they do ſo reſolve, yet they muſt be convinced whether they will or no: Truth and Reaſon plainly propoſed never want a witneſs in the Conſcience of Man, that will ſpeak ſometime or other as the thing is.</p>

            <p n="1">I. Of <hi>Man's wickedneſs</hi> in both theſe thieves, who had ſpent all their time in ſin, even to the laſt hour of their lives; but eſpecially in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent thief, whom neither Bonds, nor Tryal, nor Condemnation had humbled or mollified, or brought to repentance; but being ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of an hardned heart, we find him at the laſt gaſp rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Saviour inſtead of believing in him, and belching out his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies in the very mouth of Hell, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. <hi>If thou be Chriſt ſave thy ſelf and us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Of <hi>Divine grace</hi> in the penitent thief.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Converting</hi> grace, and that</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>power and efficacy</hi> of it; for how powerful muſt that grace needs be which had wrought ſo great a change, had ſuppled that heart in an inſtant which had been hardning in ſin for ſo many years? over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo many ſtubborn inveterate luſts at once, and made the Man all on a ſuddain commence one of the moſt eminent Saints the World had ever yet had, and act faith to ſuch an hight, as might not only have become the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles, but did really exceed any they had hitherto ſhewn? The Diſciples of Chriſt who had ſat ſo long at their Maſters feet, yet were hardly induced to believe his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, even after he was riſen, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. When this thief who hitherto had been a ſtranger to him, and now ſaw him hanging on a Croſs, and dying, yet by faith ſees him in his Kingdom triumphing over his Croſs and Death too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of it, for</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:92"/>1. Gods grace did not wait for his preparations, good moods, good diſpoſitions; (theſe were all over if ever he had any) but it takes hold of him when at the hight of ſin, and not only was void of grace, but ſeemed paſt grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> never like to come to it by any ordinary methods.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſeiſed on him and paſſed by the other, though no worſe (that we know of) than himſelf. Grace makes a difference where none was before: of theſe two, in the like caſe, it takes one and leaves the other.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Pardoning grace,</hi> This appears in our Lords anſwer and carriage to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 43. He doth not upbraid him with the abominations of his forepaſt life, his Theft, or Rapine, or Violence, his hardneſs of Heart, or long Impenitence; but eaſily, readily, gently receives him, and is ſo far from denying him a pardon, that he aſſures him of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Salvation. <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe of theſe two thieves doth in a good meaſure parallel the caſe of other dying ſinners, though dying upon their beds. They were in the extremity of their lives, drawing their laſt breath, both full of pain and anguiſh in their Bodies, and very likely full of ſhame and confuſion in their Minds, conſidering their death was not only cruel and grievous, but reproachful in the eyes of Men, and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſentence of God. So that here was much to interrupt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and diſtract them in ſo great, ſo cloſe and ſerious a work as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is. And is it not ſo with others who live in ſin all their days and pretend to Repent at laſt? They are taking their leave of the World, groaning under their Diſeaſes, racked with pains, and have many things (tho not the ſame the thieves had) to diſcompoſe, diſquiet, and divert them from or hinder them in the like work. But if we look to the iſſue, the parallel will not reach ſo far. Here is Man for Man, one of the thieves humble, believing, repenting, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted; the other unbroken, unbelieving, impenitent, and dying like a reprobate. This equality is not to be found among other dying ſinners, (as hereafter we ſhall ſee.) However from the example of theſe two thieves we may ſafely infer this Propoſition,
<q>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrin. </seg>
                  </label> That tho a very late, even a death-bed repentance may be ſincere, yet it is not ſafe to run the hazard of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Two parts there are of this Propoſition, 1. <hi>That even a death-bed repeentance may be ſincere;</hi> this I ſhall ſpeak to by way of Conceſſion. 2. <hi>That yet it is dangerous running the hazard of it,</hi> by deferring repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance till ſuch a time; this I ſhall handle by way of Aſſertion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>It is poſſible that a death-bed repentance may be ſincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this I ſhall briefly</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Premiſe ſomething in general concerning the nature of Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Lay down the <hi>reaſons of this Conceſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For the former. Repentance may be conſidered either</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:40119:92"/>I. In the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>exerciſe of it,</hi> which the Scripture uſually expreſſes by <hi>turning</hi> or <hi>returning,</hi> implying that ſinners are out of the way to God, and their own happineſs, till by repentance they return into it. If we ſpeak diſtinctly of it, we may conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Eſſence</hi> of repentance, which is the <hi>turning</hi> mentioned; a turning from ſin to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> from all ſin both of Heart and Life, as to the love, and allowance of it, and ſubjection to it; and a turning to God as our Sovereign Lord from whom we had revolted, to walk with him in all known ways of obedience and holineſs. And tho we cannot attain to a legal perfection in this Life, either as to freedom from all Sin, or the practice of all Duty, yet there is (not meerly a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tranſient, but) a peremptory, fixed, and ſetled purpoſe for the one, and againſt the other, which is more than a promiſe <hi>de futuro,</hi> and amounts to a preſent breach with all ſin, and an actual will to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in every duty, a <hi>reſpect to all Gods Comandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. in the degree of our obedience to which, we notwithſtanding may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fail.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>cauſes</hi> from which it proceeds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A <hi>right ſence of ſin,</hi> as to the guilt, defilement and dominion of it. Its being offenſive and odious to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. as well as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our ſelves, in the danger to which it expoſeth us, the blot it leaves upon us, and the tyranny it exerciſeth over us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>An apprehenſion and belief of the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus to them that do repent.</hi> This is always the principle from which Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical repentance proceeds. Tho the terrors of the Law may help to drive Men from ſin, yet there muſt be Goſpel attractives to draw them to God, either in a way of faith or repentance. Who will dare to truſt him from whom he expects no mercy, or care for ſerving him from whom he looks for no acceptance? Hence it is that Gods mercy is uſed as the grand motive to perſwade Men to repentance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;</hi> and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7.</p>
            <p>From theſe proceed both that <hi>Godly ſorrow for ſin, and that hatred</hi> of it which always accompanies Goſpel repentance, and in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure promotes it. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to place Godly ſorrow among the cauſes of repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If we conſider repentance in the <hi>habit,</hi> I need ſay no more but that it is that grace of the Holy Spirit which he infuſeth into the Soul, as the immediate ſtanding principle of actual repentance, and whereby it is both enabled, and diſpoſed to it.</p>
            <p>Now this repentance being a grace of Gods Spirit, and yet inherent in Man as to the habit, and exerciſed by him as to its acts, or, which is the ſame, being Gods work, and yet Mans duty; we are to conſider what is Gods part in it, and what is Mans.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods <hi>work</hi> is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>infuſe the grace</hi> or <hi>principle,</hi> repentance in the habit, which conſtantly is aſcribed to God in Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. <hi>Granred repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.23. <hi>If God will give them repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:93"/>2. To <hi>actuate and enliven that Principle</hi> when infuſed (as he doth other Graces, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.) not meerly in a moral way, by ſuggeſting ſuch Reaſons and Arguments as may excite and move the Will to the exerciſe of Repentance, but by the powerful and efficacious Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Grace drawing out the habit into that exerciſe, or cauſing the Soul to act ſuitably to this Divine Principle infuſed into it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Mans Duty</hi> is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſeek and labour after Repentance in the uſe of all means,</hi> by which God is wont to work it in the hearts of Men, ſuch as diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Word (Repentance no leſs than Faith comes by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.) and what external means of Grace are appointed in it: Intention of the Mind in that attendance on the means, Mens applying the Truths delivered to themſelves, comparing their Caſes with it, examining themſelves by it, conſidering their ways, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are but the actings of their reaſonable Faculties, and as much in their power as other moral Actions are, and need not the Supernatural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Divine Grace, but only thoſe common aſſiſtances God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to Man in the ordinary actions of a rational Life; and in a word, theſe are but ſuch kind of workings as <hi>ſhew</hi> them to be <hi>Men,</hi> not to be Saints, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. To theſe means, in the uſe of which God is wont to work repentance, I refer Prayer for it, which though by an unregenerate Perſon, it cannot be performed graciouſly, and unto acceptance; yet we may ſay it may be thus far performed ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as that thoſe Prayers may be heard, and anſwered in relation to the Grace they ſeek, and in the Elect of God they are heard, tho' not with reſpect to the Perſons, (which being graceleſs, faithleſs, cannot be accepted of God) yet with reſpect to his own thoughts of Love towards them, and his eternal purpoſe of conferring that Grace upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>excite and ſtir up in himſelf the Grace of Repentance,</hi> when God hath wrought it in him, for the putting forth Acts agreeable to the Principle he hath received, and to which by that Principle he is both empowred and inclined; unto the production of which Acts he is no more to queſtion the concurrence of God's Special Grace, than his common concurrence to the ordinary actings of his Reaſon and Will; it being God's uſual method to work with his Creatures according to their Natures; and thoſe Principles of Acting he hath put into them. Though God quickens Grace as well as works it, yet Man is to uſe thoſe means for the quickning it in himſelf, which God hath appointed, and with which he is wont to work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>reaſons of this Conceſſion,</hi> or which prove that a Death-bed Repentance may be ſincere.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It appears by the the <hi>inſtance of this Thief,</hi> that a late Repentance, and as late as one upon a Dying Bed, hath been ſincere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the like may be again: He did truly repent, and therefore it is poſſible others may. And that his Repentance was ſincere, we have ſufficient Proof, not only from Chriſts gracious acceptation of it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40119:93"/> by the peremptory promiſe he gave him of admitting him into his Kingdom, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> But by the other Graces we here find him exerciſing in concurrence with his repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the Principle of Evangelical Repentance, and which never fails to work it, where it is it ſelf ſincere. He owns Chriſt as a King, when he mentions his Kingdom, and prays him to remember him when he comes into it. This likewiſe implies his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of, and confidence in the Grace and Love, as well as Power of Chriſt, when he commits his departing Soul into his hands, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Salvation from him. And indeed his Faith was not only ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, but ſtrong and vigorous. God had put as much of the Spirit of Faith into a poor Novice in Religion at the very firſt, as he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many an old Diſciple at the laſt. It is a good argument of a ſtrong Faith, when it bears up againſt great diſcouragements, as we ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20. and that of the Woman of <hi>Canaan, Matth.</hi> 15. from <hi>v.</hi> 22. to 28. Two great diſcouragements the Thief had, which yet could not hinder his Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>heinouſneſs of his Sins,</hi> aggravated by long impenitence and perſeverance in them to the laſt hour, in a manner, of his Life. Well might he fear that God was ſo provoked by the continual rebellion of his wicked Life, as totally to reject him now at his Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>low and deſpicable condition he ſaw Chriſt in,</hi> condemned as well as himſelf, and hanging upon a Croſs as well as himſelf, ſlighted and mocked at by ſo many he might look on as better and wiſer than himſelf, no leſs than the Governours of the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>The Rulers derided him.</hi> This might have made him think there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope of help from him. What was there in a crucify'd dying Man, that, to an eye of reaſon, could make him look like a Saviour? Meer Nature would as ſoon have looked for Life in Death it ſelf, nay Heaven in Hell, as eternal Salvation in one, who not only had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſo mean, but now ſeemed ſo miſerable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Several <hi>other Graces</hi> we find in him, as the fruits, at leaſt the concomitants of his Repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A free, ingenuous, and open <hi>confeſſion of his Sins</hi> in the face of the World, and thereby giving glory to God, <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>We indeed juſtly,</hi> &amp;c. Nor can it be ſaid that his Confeſſion was extorted from him by the Torments he ſuffer'd, when we ſee his Companion impenitent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He <hi>owns the Juſtice that had brought him to that end: We receive the due reward of our deeds.</hi> He neither murmurs againſt God, nor quarrels with Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſharply <hi>taxeth the impiety and profaneneſs of his fellow Thief</hi> in reviling Chriſt, as well as his ſtill continuing obſtinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>Doſt not thou fear God,</hi> &amp;c. and hereby he ſhews his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt Sin, when he ſo heinouſly reſents it, not only in himſelf, but in another. Like <hi>David</hi> he <hi>beholds a tranſgreſſor, and is grieved,</hi> Pſ. 119.158.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:94"/>4. He <hi>doth what he can to bring his Companion to repentance: Doſt not thou fear God?</hi> The Reproof implies an Exhortation, as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Now the communicativeneſs of Grace is a good argument of the ſincerity of it. Had he had none himſelf, he would not have been ſo much concerned for the others want of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He makes a <hi>publick profeſſion of his faith in Chriſt,</hi> and owns him to the very teeth of his Enemies, and that too when <hi>Peter</hi> had denied him, the other Diſciples forſaken him, and thoſe that had rallied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their rout, and were now come to be the Spectators of the moſt doleful Object had ever been preſented before their eyes, were ſo far from making any ſuch publick confeſſion of him, that their Faith was ready to expire with him, <hi>ch.</hi> 24.21.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Repentance being Gods gift, and God being a Sovereign Agent, he may give it where, and when he pleaſeth;</hi> as to whom he will; to one and not to another; ſo at what time he will; to one ſooner, to another later. He may give it to one early in the morning of his days, to another late, and when his Sun is Setting. And if the great Maſter of the Vineyard ſhall call ſome into it, not only at the ſixth or ninth hour, but even at the laſt minute of the eleventh hour, what is that to any? who ſhall call him to an account for it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. God, being not only a Sovereign Agent, but <hi>an Almighty one, can by his Power, and that in an inſtant, remove all hindrances on the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures part,</hi> and whatever might obſtruct his work; and ſo with one turn of an Omnipotent hand, <hi>bring about the heart</hi> of the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sinner, work repentance in the moſt unlikely Subject, and where there is moſt within to make head againſt him, and reſiſt his Grace, ſuppoſe the moſt obſtinate and rooted habits of ſin. Grace is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and ſupernatural habit, and the power that works it a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and creating Power; and we are not to confine God in his working Grace, to thoſe methods whereby men acquire natural or moral habits. In theſe, I grant, there may need time to unlearn, and extirpate thoſe vitious habits they have ſo long been contracting, and to acquire new ones by a long ſeries of, and accuſtoming themſelves to better actions. Cuſtom in Men may be ſtrong, and like another Nature, and they may not be able preſently to overcome it, nor on the ſudden to bring themſelves to a readineſs and eaſineſs in doing thoſe things, which tho their reaſon approves, yet their boyſterous appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, (ſtrengthned too by cuſtom) hurry them againſt. But let the habit of ſin be never ſo deeply radicated in the Soul, and the Heart of Man never ſo averſe to holy actions, yet God can ſoon make a change; ſoon remove the ſinful diſpoſition, and enable and encline the Soul to what it was moſt averſe and impotent. He can even in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment overcome that love of ſin, and hatred of holineſs which is either natural to a Man, or contracted by him, and both abate, leſſen, weaken the power of ſin in the Soul, whereby it was wont to reſiſt the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Spirit, and reſtrain and ſuſpend any actual reſiſtance it might make. Let the mind of a Man be as dark as darkneſs it ſelf,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40119:94"/> yet <hi>he that cauſed light to ſhine out of darkneſs</hi> can enlighten that mind when he pleaſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. Let the Soul be never ſo <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> and deſtitute of all Spiritual Life, yet he <hi>that quickens the dead, and calls things that are not as tho they were,</hi> Rom. 4.17. can quicken it, and breathe the Breath of Spiritual Life into it; and whatever there be in the Soul to oppoſe him in his working, yet the ſame power can at once quell the oppoſition, and produce the Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God having infuſed the habit can as eaſily <hi>enliven it, and draw it out into act,</hi> in thoſe that are capable of exerciſing grace wrought in them, as I ſuppoſe dying ſinners to be, at leaſt when they are capable of exerciſing their rational faculties. For there is leſs to make oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt God than in the former caſe, the prevailing power of ſin being broken; and ſomething in the Soul to take Gods part in the work, <hi>viz.</hi> grace now begun, and ſome habitual promptneſs and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the heart to ſpiritual good, and compliance with the will of God. It doth not require more power to awaken a vital principle, tho dormant, than to infuſe it where there was none before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may be for <hi>Gods honour ſometimes to give Repentance to dying ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> the honour of his Sovereignty, and free Grace, in ſhewing that he <hi>hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> Rom. 3.18. and that the deepeſt guilt even of an old hardned ſinner cannot hinder the outgoings of his grace and mercy: and the honour of his power when it prevails over the moſt ſetled habits of corruption. Should God work only upon leſſer ſinners, and who are not ſo confirmed in evil, Man might be apt to think that he could not do it, and that Mens luſts might be too hard for his power, and ſo reflect on his Omnipotence; or to think he could not find in his heart to do it, and ſo reflect upon his Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By way of <hi>Poſition</hi> or <hi>Aſſertion, It is a very dangerous thing to run the hazard of a death-bed Repentance,</hi> or defer Repentance till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death; that is, to neglect the doing a Mans own part in order to the obtaining this grace (as was above premiſed) <hi>viz.</hi> the ſeeking it of God, and uſing all thoſe means by which he ordinarily works it. The danger of this neglect may appear by the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>no Man knows the time of his death,</hi> any more than the <hi>manner of it, or means by which it ſhall be brought about.</hi> Our <hi>breath is in Gods hands,</hi> Dan. 5.23. No Man hath a leaſe of his earthly Tabernacle, but is Tenant at will to his great Landlord. Who knows when he ſhall die, or how? Whether a natural death or a violent one? To how many thouſand unforeſeen accidents are Men ſubject? Not only Swords and Axes may diſpatch them, but God can commiſſion Inſects and Vermin to be the executioners of his juſtice upon them.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hatto</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Mentz.</hi>
               </note> A great Prelate may be eaten up of Mice, and a potent Prince devoured by Worms, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. And who doth not carry the principles of his own diſſolution perpetually within him? Death lies in ambuſh in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vain, in every member, and none know when it may aſſault them. It doth not always warn before it ſtrikes. If ſome Diſeaſes are Croni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:95"/> others are Acute and leſs lingring, and ſome are as quick as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; kill in an inſtant. Men may be well in one moment, and dead in the next. God <hi>ſhoots his arrows at them,</hi> they are <hi>ſuddenly wounded, Pſal.</hi> 64.7. How many are taken away not only in the midſt of their days, but in the midſt of their ſins? The luſting Iſraelites with the fleſh between their teeth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33. <hi>Julian</hi> (if Hiſtorians ſpeak truth) with blaſphemy in his mouth; and how many frequently with the Wine in their heads? In ſuch caſes what place, what time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, for ſeeking it, for uſing means to attain it, when they have not room for ſo much as a thought of it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe Men have time and warning given them; Death knocks at the door before it enters, and beſieges them before it ſtorms them: they lie by the brink of the grave before they fall into it: yet, <hi>they may want the Means of grace by which God ordinarily works,</hi> when he brings Men to Repentance. Publick Ordinances in ſuch a caſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have, and private ones they may not have. They may have none with them that have the <hi>tongue of the Learned, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon</hi> to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4. they may lack oyl, but have none that can tell them where they may buy it. None that underſtand the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, none that can inſtruct them in it, or direct them how they may attain it. Friends may be as carnal and ignorant, and unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the things of God as themſelves: and ſo may Miniſters be ſometimes. They may <hi>ſeek a viſion of the Prophet,</hi> but <hi>the Law may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from the Prieſt, and counſel from the Ancient,</hi> Ezek. 7.26.

               </gap>nce in Man or any grace without means, by his immediate power, or by ſome extraordinary means; but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promiſeth to do it, and therefore it is a bold preſuming, and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to expect he ſhould. What if God once ſtopt a ſinner in the midſt of his carrear, when not only running away from the means of Salvation, but bidding defiance to them, and converted him in a miraculous way, by a glorious light ſhining about him, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate voice of Chriſt to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</note> ſhall others hope for the like? Live in ſin all their days and look for converſion by miracle at laſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If they have means when they come to die, yet <hi>they may not have an heart to uſe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, By reaſon of <hi>bodily weakneſs,</hi> failing of natural Spirits, racking and tormenting pains which often afflict Men in ſuch a caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Theſe may blunt and dull Mens minds, or diſtract them, and draw away the intention of them from other things, and hold them only to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their preſent anguiſh. How unfit are Men for ſerious minding even of their Worldly affairs when under bodily indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how much more than unfit for Spiritual work? When the Soul is wholly taken up with helping the body, (with which it ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizes) to bear its preſent burden, it is ill at leaſure to think of any thing elſe. The Iſraelites <hi>harkned not to</hi> Moſes (tho ſent of God to deliver them) <hi>for anguiſh of Spirit and cruel bondage,</hi> Exod. 6.9. and is it any wonder if a Man groaning under a diſtemper, ſcarce able to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40119:95"/> bear his pain, or think of any thing but his pain, be in an ill caſe to look into his Heart, conſider his ways, liſten to the beſt counſil, joyn with the beſt prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Gods children that have grace in their Hearts, yet in time of ſickneſs may through preſent weakneſs find much indiſpoſedneſs in themſelves to the actings of grace, ſo that they are fain to bring forth their old ſtore, and comfort themſelves with their former experiences rather than with the preſent frame of their Hearts, what wonder is it if they that are altogether graceleſs be alike indiſpoſed to ſeek for grace?</p>
            <p>Secondly, By reaſon of <hi>contracted hardneſs.</hi> Men are naturally back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to good, but much more when habituated to evil: for the more inclined they are to evil, the more averſe they are to good; and the more accuſtomed they are to ſin, the more inclined they are to it. The practice of ſin hardens the Heart, and ſtrengthens the ſinning diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and ſtill the longer Men continue in ſin the ſtronger ſuch diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions grow. Hence the Apoſtles advice to the Hebrews, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another, while it is called to day, leſt your Hearts be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> implying that that would follow upon their continuance in ſin. We ſee even in natural things that Mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtomed to one ſort of actions, unfits them for another. When Men have lived in the practice of ſin all their days, and their natural diſpoſition to ſin is hightned into an habit, it is not ſtrange if they be much more averſe to the contrary good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>How can you that are accuſtomed to evil, learn to do well?</hi> If one groſs ſin in a believer may ſo debilitate and enfeeble thoſe gracious diſpoſitions that were before in him as to unfit him for, and deaden him to ſpiritual duties, to what a ſuperlative hardneſs may a thouſand and a thouſand repeated acts of wilful ſin bring the Heart of a carnal Man, and to what, not only averſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to any good, but confirmedneſs againſt all?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>They cannot work repentance in themſelves,</hi> not make the means effectual for the enlightning of their minds, the changing, ſoftning, ſpiritualizing their Hearts, or working a vital principle in them. If they ſay they can, either they muſt aſſume to themſelves a Creating power, a power of making themſelves new Creatures, or creating this grace in their own Hearts, there being nothing of it in them by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and antecedently to their making ſuch a change: Or they muſt ſay that there is ſome ſeed of grace in them beforehand, ſome root or ſtock which being watered and cultivated by outward means, diligence and induſtry may be made fruitful; ſo that the working repentance in them is not the infuſing a new principle into them, but a correcting of the old one: Converſion, not the giving or creating in them a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only a freeing the old one from its former impediments, and ſetting it at liberty to its proper actions. But this is</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Contrary to the whole current of Scripture,</hi> which affirms Mans will ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to be void of all ſaving good, and impotent to it till renewed by grace, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> Rom. 5.6. <hi>When we were without ſtrength,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. We <hi>are not ſufficient of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:96"/> our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves:</hi> And prone to evil, <hi>Job</hi> 15.16. <hi>Man drinks iniquity like water,</hi> Prov. 2.14. <hi>Rejoyceth to do evil,</hi> Rom. 6.17. <hi>He is a ſervant of ſin,</hi> Gen. 6.5. <hi>All the imaginations of his Heart are only evil continually,</hi> Eph. 2.1. <hi>He is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> This is broadly to charge a lie upon the God of truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To deprive God of the glory of one of his chiefeſt works,</hi> the new Creation, in which he is ſaid to put forth the ſame power which he did in creating the World at firſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and in raiſing up Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. compared with, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.1. They are ſaid to be <hi>born of the Spirit, John</hi> 3.5. And <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of God,</hi> John 1.15. Whereas they that aſſert the contrary, take Gods work out of his hands, and grudge him the honour of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To go contrary to the common ſence of the believing World.</hi> Believers generally know, as having found it by experience, that they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impotent to ſpiritual good. They find much weakneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after grace is wrought in them, and nothing but weakneſs before God work it. They acknowledge they cannot work any degree of grace in themſelves, when ſome already they have; much leſs could they work it in themſelves when they really had none. And how come others to have more ſtrength than they? Did not they fall in <hi>Adam?</hi> Or had his Apoſtaſie a leſs malignant influence upon them than upon others? How come they to have ſuch a reſerve of Spiritual ſtrength when the reſt of the World hath loſt it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If they can work repentance in themſelves <hi>why do they not do it ſooner?</hi> Why do they defer it ſo long when they cannot deny but one time or other it muſt be wrought? Is it a fit return to God for the goodneſs he hath ſhewn them all their days, to live in ſin all their days and turn to him when they can live no longer in it? Or will it be an acceptable anſwer to him, when he calls them to a reckoning, that they had not ſerved ſin long enough, nor had their fill of their luſts, or elſe they would have turned to him ſooner?</p>
            <p n="5">5. And how many be there who to encourage themſelves in their preſent impenitency, and the enjoyments of their ſinful pleaſures, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they can turn themſelves when they pleaſe; yet if <hi>God open their eyes, and awaken their Conſciences,</hi> and they begin in good earneſt to ſet themſelves to labour after repentance, <hi>they are ſoon convinced of the hardneſs and deadneſs of their Hearts and their utter diſabilities to ſuch a work,</hi> and are fain, in ſpight of all their high thoughts, and conceits of themſelves to look up to God, and implore his aſſiſtance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for the working of that grace in them which they fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagined they could work in themſelves?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>God may not give them grace to repent when they come to die.</hi> Admit they have time and means, yet God may not give a bleſſing to the means. Let it be conſidered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>To how few God ever gives repentance at the laſt,</hi> even of thoſe who have as good means and helps as their weak, and dying condition
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40119:96"/> will admit of. It is one of the ſaddeſt parts of a Miniſters work to viſit dying ſinners. How few do they leave any better than they find them? How few give any hopes of a through change wrought in them? How few can they perſwade to believe in Chriſt when they have an hundred times before rejected him? How few can they bring to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then, when they never minded it before? Miniſters even the beſt are but Men and not God, fleſh and not Spirit; and means, inſtructions, exhortations, are but means, whoſe whole efficacy depends on Gods co-operation with them; and when he with-holds his Bleſſing, they are altogether ineffectual. When they judge of man's eternal State, though their judgment is not to be raſh nor peremptory, yet it ſhould be reaſonable; ſome good grounds they ſhould have for it. But alas! if they keep to Scripture-rules, in how few of them that never repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, do they find, when dying, ſo much as a foundation for a charitable judgment of their Spiritual ſtate?</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we ſet aſide thoſe that <hi>die in groſs ignorance</hi> of the things of God, of the very firſt Principles of Religion, the nature of God, the Offices of Chriſt, the ends of his Death, the neceſſity of ſatisfaction for ſin, the nature and uſe of Faith, the terms of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ignorant indeed of thoſe truths, ſome knowledge of which is neceſſary to the very being of ſaving Grace. How many ſuch do we find? and what hope can we have of the truth of their Repentance, and ſo of their Salvation? How can their Hearts be holy, when their Minds are ſo blind? What Heavenly heat can their be in there affections, when there is ſuch an helliſh darkneſs in their underſtandings? Such may read their doom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Set aſide thoſe that <hi>die ſtupid,</hi> without any awakenings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, any ſenſe or concernedneſs about their ſpiritual ſtate, and ſo die as much like Beaſts as they lived.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe that <hi>die deſpairing,</hi> fill'd with horror, and void of hope; overwhelmed with the ſenſe of ſin, the thoughts of approaching ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and a fearful expectation of appearing before the Tribunal of that righteous God, whom they cannot eſcape, and dare not truſt. They have not hearts to pray to him, hope in him, or commit their Souls into his hands when they die, having never loved, nor ſerved, nor regarded him while they lived.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe that <hi>die preſuming.</hi> Such are the ignorant before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; ſuch are Formaliſts, Moraliſts, proud Phariſees, conceited ſelf-juſtifiers. The Innocency of their Converſation, the Profeſſion they make, or the Duties they perform, are the righteouſneſs by which they expect to be juſtified. Nay, how many after a Life of ſin hope to be ſaved, meerly by the mercy of God, without reſpect to any righteouſneſs at all, either of Juſtification, or Sanctification; either imputed to them, or inherent in them; either that whereby they may have a title to glory, or meetneſs for it? Sure I am, ſuch as theſe are void of repentance; and when the greateſt part of dying Sinners may be reduced to one or other of theſe ſorts, to how few doth God
<pb facs="tcp:40119:97"/> give repentance at the laſt, of thoſe, who did not before ſeek it of him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>With how many is the day of Grace paſt,</hi> and the time of God's patience run out? and then we may be ſure God will not give them repentance: They have ſo many times rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves; <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. refuſed the Offers of Grace, turned a deaf ear to the calls of the Goſpel, ſtiffned their necks, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to return, that now they are paſt it. God that waited on them ſo long, will wait no longer. They had a time of acceptation, a day of ſalvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. but that being over, they are to have no more. God was nigh to them, and might have been found of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. but is now withdrawn from them, and they may <hi>ſeek</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and die in their ſins, John</hi> 8.21. the may <hi>ſeek and not find, call, and God give them no anſwer,</hi> Prov. 1.28.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>God may have judicially hardned their Hearts,</hi> when they had ſinfully hardened them before. And this ſeems to be one great cauſe of that ſtupidneſs and inſenſibleneſs we ſo often find in Sinners at the time of death. True, God infuſeth no ſin into them; yet he may wholly abandon them to the power of the hardneſs they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and give them up into the Devils hands, to delude and blind, to act and manage them according to his pleaſure, and their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclinations. They may not have ſo much as an heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to repent, or pray to God for Grace to enable them to to it, all thoſe common aſſiſtances of Gods Spirit they ſometimes had, being wholly withdrawn from them and it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Partly as a <hi>puniſhment for their former wilful impenitency.</hi> It is one of the moſt dreadful Judgments God ever executes upon any on this ſide Hell, when he puniſhes one ſin with another, one hardneſs with another, which yet ſometimes he doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>Iſrael would none of me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo I gave them up,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>a terror to others,</hi> and a <hi>warning too,</hi> that they that hear it may fear, and not dare to live impenitently, leſt they ſhould die impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently; God not being bound to give them the Grace he denies to others, who perhaps were not greater Sinners than themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The great encouragement Men have to embolden them in ſin, and yet to hope for repentance at laſt, is the inſtance of this poor Thief, which they ſtretch beyond the intention of the Holy Ghoſt in leaving it upon Record, when they uſe it as a means to ſtrengthen their preſumption, which was deſigned only to prevent deſpair. The Thief on the Croſs repented at laſt, ſaith a Sinner, and why may not I?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Why ſhould not the example of the other Thief's impenitency af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them, and drive them to repentance, as well as the example of the good Thief encourage them to ſin?</hi> It is but ſetting one againſt the other; and if they argue, God gave repentance to one, and therefore may give it them: Why may they not as well argue, God denied it to one, and therefore may deny it to them too?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:40119:97"/>2. <hi>It is but a ſingle inſtance againſt thouſands on the other ſide.</hi> And though one inſtance is ſufficient to evert the generality of a Rule; and therefore we cannot certainly conclude from Gods not giving repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to thouſands at the hour of Death, that he will give it to none, becauſe we have the example of this Thief to the contrary; yet with what reaſon can men expect that God ſhould give that to them, which he gave to one, rather than that he ſhould deny that to them, which he hath denied to thouſands? If general Rules are to be drawn from particulars, it is much more rational to ground them on a multitude of particulars, than on any ſingle one. The moſt therefore any Men can infer from this example, is only, that it is not impoſſible but God may give them repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Some things ſeem to be ſingular in the caſe of this Thief,</hi> which are not to be found in the caſe of others, who therefore cannot reaſonably argue from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was one (ſo far as we can judge) <hi>that had never formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Chriſt,</hi> never ſaw him before his Sufferings, never heard his Doctrin, never was a Witneſs of his Miracles which might convince him of the truth of it. He was one that had otherwiſe employed himſelf, than in attending on Chriſts Miniſtry, and might more likely have been found robbing on the Road, than worſhiping in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or breaking up Houſes, than hearing of Sermons; and therefore though he had ſin enough in him for which God might have denied him Repentance, and nothing in him which might move the Lord to give it him; yet it is very probable this was the firſt of his being brought to the knowledge of a Saviour, and ſo he was not guilty of the great Goſpel-ſin of Unbelief, and refuſing the offer of Chriſt and Salvation by him, which doth ſo often provoke the Lord to leave men to themſelves, and deny them his Grace. If it be ſaid, the ſame was the caſe of the other Thief; I grant it: But God being a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Agent, and his gifts moſt free, he might make uſe of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in diſpenſing them, and ſo grant repentance to the one, and deny it to the other, admit their circumſtances were every way the ſame. And why then may he not deny repentance to thoſe now, that are (in ſome reſpect) worſe than either, in that they have ſo many times reſiſted his Spirit, ſtood out againſt his Calls, and ſlighted the offers of his Grace made to them? and where is the Sinner that lives under the means without repentance, but as he hath daily repeated calls from God, ſo he daily rejects them, and thereby abundantly juſtifies the Lords refuſing him that Grace at the laſt, which he did before not only never ſeriouſly ſeek, but wilfully reject: I ſhould have more charitable thoughts, and better hopes of the verieſt Varlets upon earth, that were never called till the laſt hour, than of thoſe that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe guilty of much leſs ſin, but have abuſed and reſiſted greater Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inſtance of this Thief ſeems particularly <hi>deſigned by God for the honour of his ſuffering Son.</hi> God would have a Witneſs even upon
<pb facs="tcp:40119:98"/> the Croſs; one to adore him when ſo many deſpiſed him: He would have his Sons Death honoured by his giving Life to a poor Wretch even at the point of Death, and make him known to be a <hi>Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 5.31. by his giving both to ſuch a Sinner, and at ſuch a time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another end may be, <hi>to render them that Crucified Chriſt inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable,</hi> when this Malefactor made ſo honourable a confeſſion of him, to expoſe and ſhame the unbelief and hardneſs of the Rulers and Phariſees by the faith and repentance of a moſt flagitious Offender, and therewithal confirm the Word of Chriſt ſpoken formerly to them, that the <hi>Publicans and Harlots entred into the Kingdom of Heaven before them,</hi> Matth. 21.31.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Suppoſe God do give them repentance at the laſt, yet <hi>they may have very little,</hi> it may be <hi>no comfort in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>They may be ready to queſtion the ſincerity of it,</hi> and then they can have little comfort in it. Admit their condition be ſafe, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable it cannot be, ſo long as the truth of their repentance, from which their comfort ſhould proceed, is ſo uncertain and queſtionable. To ſay nothing of their ignorance of the nature of repentance, and the methods of the Spirit in working it, having never found the like in themſelves before, nor been acquainted with what others have felt, many things there are which ſometimes may make them call what they find in themſelves in queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>experience they have already had of the deceitfulneſs of their own hearts,</hi> and perhaps of <hi>others in the like condition.</hi> It may be they have known others upon a ſick bed look as like Penitents as they now do, who yet upon their recovery from their Diſeaſes, have relapſed into ſin, and by returning to their former Luſts, have confuted their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and evidenc'd their repentance to have been unſound and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical. And this may make them fear leſt things may be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with themſelves, and their repentings no more real than their Neighbours. Or it may be they themſelves formerly, when under a Sentence of Death, have had ſtrong convictions of ſin, been filled with horror of Conſcience, and diſmal apprehenſions of approaching dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It may be they have greived for ſin, been vex'd at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their old Follies; it may be they have had good deſires and purpoſes, made promiſes and vows of devoting themſelves to the fear of God, and never again returning to their former ſinful courſes, if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to reſtore them; and yet no ſooner were they raiſed up again, but they changed their purpoſes, brake their promiſes, ſtifled or wore off their convictions, and grew worſe than before; the Devil that went out of them when they were ſick, returned into them when well, and ſeven more with him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43. &amp;c. And they know not but things might be as bad with them now, if God ſhould reſtore them, as they have heretofore been; They fear leſt their Hearts, which they have found ſo deceitful, fickle, ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould play tricks with them, and diſſemble, and pretend what
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40119:98"/> they never mean; and ſo from the trial they have had of them they dare not truſt them, but ſuſpect all their preſent relenting, mourning, confeſſion, mortification, to be falſe and counterfeit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be more <hi>difficult at ſuch a time to diſcern the principle from which their repentance proceeds;</hi> whether from Faith in Chriſt, love to God, and hatred of ſin, or only from fear of Wrath and Hell; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they mourn as Children under a Fathers hand, or only as ſlaves under a Maſters whip. When they lie upon the brink of the grave, and expect every moment to drop into it; their Souls are diſlodging, leaving their bodies, and by and by to appear naked before their Judge; this may affect them, fill them with fear, and fear with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin, whereby they have expoſed themſelves to the danger of damnation; and both together put them upon reſolutions againſt ſin, which is uſual in ſuch caſes. Now though there may be ſomething elſe at the bottom, yet this lying uppermoſt, and moſt obvious to their view, they may fear that it is the only prevailing argument, and great cauſe of their repentance; which can then be no better than meerly legal, as having no better a foundation. Principles are uſually latent, and diſcoverable only by their workings, and that too more eaſily or difficultly in proportion to the intenſeneſs or weakneſs of theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and in this caſe the more weak and feeble ſtirrings of Faith or Love may be ſo outdone and overtop'd by the vehement and ſtrong motions of fear, that themſelves can hardly be perceived, much leſs the principles they flow from. A dying ſinner may feel his fear when he cannot perceive his Faith, and ſuſpect he hath no Faith becauſe he is ſo full of fear; and conſequently queſtion his repentance which cannot be Evangelical without an Evangelical principle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are apt to <hi>doubt of the truth of their repentance for want of ſeeing the fruit of it.</hi> And indeed in their circumſtances, when they have ſo little time to live, they cannot ſee much. The fruits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in an holy, humble, mortified converſation, are the beſt proof of its ſincerity, and ſo moſt like to bring in the comforts of it. But their repentance being young, green, and unripe, they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever it might bring forth fruit, and ſo may eaſily be induced to ſuſpect the nature of it. How warm ſoever, for the preſent, their hearts are, yet they may queſtion the continuance of ſuch a frame if life ſhould continue. As much as at preſent they are ſet againſt ſin, yet they know not but if they ſhould again be in a capacity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, they might be again reconciled to it. They have but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entred upon the ways of God, and know not whether they ſhould like them upon further trial of them; whether as ſickneſs and fear of death have begun to mortifie their luſts, ſo the temptations of life and health might not again reſtore them. They never yet knew what it is to be Godly in time of health and eaſe, in the midſt of the ſnares and allurements of the World, and ſo know not whether that appearance of godlineſs they now have, be any more than an appearance, which upon the approach of agreeable temptations might eaſily vaniſh. Men
<pb facs="tcp:40119:99"/> ſeldom judge of Trees but by the fruit they bear. A Crab-tree may have as fair a bloſſom as the ſweeteſt Pipin. Here may be fair buds, and leaves, and bloſſoms, ſorrow for ſin, reſolutions againſt it, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of new obedience; yet they may ſuſpect all for want of ſeeing the fruit of their repentance in the acts of obedience; a ſetled courſe of walking with God, and progreſs in mortification.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Devil is moſt like to be buſie with them at ſuch a time.</hi> He is a never failing enemy to Mens Souls, and ſhews his enmity to their very death; and as he makes it his buſineſs to keep them from repentance, ſo if he cannot do that, he labours to bereave them of the comfort of it, by making them queſtion the truth of it. As where it is falſe he is ready to flatter them, and perſwade them it is true that he may draw them into preſumption; ſo where it is ſincere he labours to terrifie them, by perſwading them it is hypocritical, that he may run them into deſpair. Thus he doth with Men while they live, and why may he not do the ſame when they die? He is like at that time either for ever to have them, or for ever to loſe them: his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then are his laſt efforts, and therefore moſt vigorous; and ſuch they may be, as though, the grace of God preventing, they may not hinder the true repentance of a dying ſinner, yet, the wiſdom of God permitting, they may cloud and obſcure it and render it queſtionable, and thereby bereave him of the comfort of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They may be ready to <hi>queſtion Gods acceptance of their repentance,</hi> and indeed that muſt needs be, if they queſtion the ſincerity of it, when God never accepts any but what is ſincere. But beſides, they may be ready to fear they have outſtood their time, that the day of grace, which is the only time of Gods accepting them, is at an end: Or, that God will not accept of them as his Servants, when they cannot live to do him any ſervice; or not accept of their returning to him now, who have forſaken him ſo long; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their ſorrow for formerly diſhonouring him, when they are paſt time for glorifying him; and in a word, not look upon them as his Children at the laſt hour, who have been the Devils Children all their days. Now if this be their caſe, how uncomfortable is a death-bed repentance, admit it be ſound, when Men know not that it is ſound, but are wholly in the dark as to the ſincerity and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, and ſo ſet in a cloud and fear a ſtorm? They may have even juſt ſo much hope as may keep them from deſpair, not what may cauſe any rejoycing in them; a ſecret and almoſt inſenſible ſupport, but no enlargement. They do but (as was ſaid of the penitent Thief in the Text) <hi>ſteal</hi> into Heaven, and are ſo ſaved as that no body in this World knows it, nor they themſelves till they find it. And God may purpoſely conceal it to prevent the folly and preſumption of others. If Gods Children after many years ſpent in ſerious and diligent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, yet (for reaſons beſt known to the Divine Wiſdom) have ſometimes died in the dark; they then that ſpend their days in ſin, and think to repent at laſt, ſhould remember that the beſt they can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40119:99"/> expect, if God ſhould give them repentance, muſt be to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fear and hope, or it may be more full of fear than hope. No comfort they can expect in reflecting upon their forepaſt life, where they ſee nothing but ſin; and little in the hopes of future glory, when they have not one clear evidence of their title to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude.</hi> May not the conſideration of a Mans repenting no ſooner, abate his comfort in repenting at laſt? May not, will not that gracious ingenuity God hath now wrought in ſuch a one, make ſevere reflections upon his long impenitency, and not turning to God till he was paſt ſerving him? And then may not the Devil ſet in and maliciouſly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it to the ſinners Conſcience, and hold the mind ſo fix'd and intent upon the thoughts of repenting no ſooner, as to divert it from the contemplation of that grace which hath now wrought repentance in him, and thereby diminiſh the comfort he might take in it?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Information.</hi> If it be ſo dangerous to run the hazard of a death-bed <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>I</label> repentance, how great is their <hi>folly</hi> that do ſo? They that defer their repentance till they come to die, ſhew themſelves fools.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In putting off the greateſt work till they have leaſt time for the doing of it, if any at all.</hi> A Man would be accounted a fool as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of this life that ſhould idle away the time of his youth, and vigorous age, and defer ſeeking for an Eſtate, and providing for his Family, till he were old and decrepit and paſt working. And is it not a greater work to provide for Eternity than for time, to drive a Spiritual trade than a Civil one, and get a ſtock of Grace than of Riches? And then what fools are they that put off ſuch a work to the laſt, and leave themſelves no time for it but that which is moſt unfit for it, as well as uncertain whether they ſhall enjoy it? Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as to the exerciſe of it, is not the work of a day, but ſhould be the work of all a Mans days; and what folly is it to thruſt that into a little corner of a Mans life, which ſhould be extended through the whole of it? A Chriſtians work is not to be done all at once; it is a <hi>walk,</hi> a <hi>race,</hi> a <hi>courſe</hi> of holy, gracious actings, and that requires time. Repentance (as it implies our firſt turning from ſin to God) is but the entrance upon or beginning of that courſe, and how fooliſh are they that think to run their race in an inſtant, to begin their courſe and finiſh it at once?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>reckoning upon time which they cannot command.</hi> Men may with <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 29.2. <hi>wiſh</hi> that they were, <hi>as in the months paſt,</hi> but they cannot make themſelves be ſo. And ſo likewiſe they may wiſh time back, but cannot bring it back, or ſtop its motion as it runs, nor have they the leaſt particle of it in their power. How fooliſh then is it to defer repentance while they have time for it, till they come to a ſick bed where they are not ſecure of any! Alas they can no more add one inch to their time than one cubit to their ſtature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>promiſing themſelves the doing of that which is not in their own power to do.</hi> Though the exerciſe of repentance, as above was ſaid, is
<pb facs="tcp:40119:100"/> Mans duty, yet it is ſuch a duty as he cannot practiſe without the grace of repentance wrought in him; (the principle muſt be ere the act can be) and that grace is the gift of God; and if he do not give it, Man cannot have it; and if he will not give it, who can force him to do it? They that would command Gods grace, muſt command God himſelf; and they that defer their repentance till they die, muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either that they can work it in themſelves, which hath already been diſproved, or that God will be at their beck to do it for them; which needs no diſproving.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>thinking to do the work beſt when they have made it moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and painful.</hi> Though (as was before ſaid) God can by his power in an inſtant remove all obſtructions, and work repentance in the moſt obdurate ſinner; yet in his ordinary method he works gradually, and in the way of means, Mens attendance upon Ordinances, Seeking, and Labouring after repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Men have no reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould diſuſe his wonted manner of working to gratifie their ſloth and loytering. Now it is certain that the longer Men live in ſin, the more their hearts will cleave to it, and be hardned in it; and then the more loth they will be to be divorced from it, and the more averſe to the uſe of thoſe means whereby ſuch a ſeparation might be effected. The more ſweetneſs they have taſted in ſin, the more bitter will the very thoughts of repentance be: Strong affections to their luſts will make prayers cold and endeavours faint againſt them. Hence we ſee God handles old ſtubborn ſinners more roughly, when he reduces them, for the moſt part, than others upon whom he works more early. Indeed their caſe requires it. They need more of the <hi>Lords terrors,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.) to drive them off from ſin, more Law-thunder to awaken their Conſciences, and rouze them out of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and more ſevere means to humble and break them, to imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin to them, and make them heartily willing to forſake it. What pangs and tortures, horrors of Conſcience, Soul-convulſions do fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſinners procure to themſelves, by their lingring, and delaying, which had they been more quick and ſpeedy in their work might have been prevented, at leaſt very much mitigated?</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Can you have the face to put God off with the worſt you can give him? And the leaſt too,</hi> of your time, and ſtrength, and ſervice, when he calls for the beſt, and deſerves all? Hath God given you a life of many years, and can you afford him only the ſervice of a few days; it may be hours, it may be minutes; nay, it may be none at all? Is it fair, ingenuous, reaſonable to give the Devil your ſtrength, and God your weakneſs? To give the Devil and your luſts, your health, and God your ſickneſs? To ſerve ſin with your might, and vigour, and God with your diſtempers, and infirmities? Not to be willing to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40119:100"/> part with your ſins till you are parting with your lives, nor begin your work till your time is ending? and, in a word, to begin then only to ſerve God, when you can ſerve your ſelves, your Friends, nay your Luſts no longer?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſooner you ſet about the work, the more eaſie you will find it.</hi> You will have fewer Sins to repent of, and mourn over, and turn from, leſs guilt to terrifie and diſhearten you, leſs ſtupor in your Conſciences, leſs hardneſs in your Hearts, leſs ſtrength of ſin to be wreſtled with. The Dominion of ſin will not be ſo confirmed with a long tract of time; nor the cords of your iniquity hold you ſo faſt. Tho it be true, that how ſoon ſoever you begin, and ſet about the work, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of your ſelves effect it; God's Grace muſt do that; yet the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you begin, the leſs ſin there will be in you to reſiſt his Grace, and the more hope that God will afford you Grace to overcome that reſiſtance which is made. And tho Grace can ſubdue and conquer the moſt ſtrong, old, overgrown Luſts, yet ſtill you will be more ready to hope it will do it, when you have not the guilt of a long impenitent Life; and refuſing former calls to encourage your unbelief, and check your hopes, and ſink your hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>You may expect more comfort in it,</hi> for the more able you will be to diſcern its ſincerity, as having leſs cauſe to doubt of it. To turn to God when you have ſomething to deny for him, ſome time to ſpend in his Service, and which might have been ſpent in the ſervice of ſin, looks much more like true repentance, than to turn to him when you are immediately to appear before him. The leſs force and fear there is in your repentance, the more like it is to be kindly and evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; when tears flow, and are not ſqueezed; you are rather drawn than driven; and your Obedience is freely yielded, rather than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted. But the further ye apprehend your ſelves from Death and Judgment, the leſs there uſually is to force your repentance, and ſo the leſs to make it ſuſpicious, and hinder your enjoying the comfort of it. And ſo the ſooner you repent, the more time you will have to prove its ſincerity by its fruits, and the more <hi>fruit you bring forth meet for repentance,</hi> Matth. 3.8. the better ſatisfy'd ye will be as to the truth of it, and have the more comfort in it. When you cannot ſo well judge of it by looking to it immediately in the principle, you may be better able to judge of it by its actings; as tho the root of a Tree be hid under ground, yet good fruit will ſhew it to be good.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider <hi>what you loſe by putting repentance off to the laſt;</hi> beſide the comfort of your death (as was above intimated) ye loſe no leſs than all the comfort of your Lives; the comfort of all the good you might have done, all the Grace you might have acted, all the glory you might have brought to God. A Chriſtians greateſt comfort is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of faith and holineſs, the comfort of walking with God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in Duties and Ordinances, the comfort of exerciſing his Graces, and reflecting upon his Graces, of ſeeing his priviledges, his intereſt in the promiſes, his title to his inheritance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:101"/> where no Grace is, there no true comfort can be; and where repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not, there no other Grace can be; no Faith, for that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the cauſe of Evangelical repentance; and no holineſs, for that always ſuppoſeth Repentance as the beginning of it. There can be no walking in the <hi>narrow way,</hi> if there be not firſt an entring in at the <hi>ſtrait Gate.</hi> Wiſdoms ways are <hi>ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> Prov. 3.17. but they only experience that pleaſantneſs that walk in that way; and walk in it you cannot, if you do not enter into it, and that muſt be by repentance, which is your very firſt ſtepping into it. Think then what comforts the Saints enjoy in their Lives, what it is that makes them chearful in their Duties, couragious againſt their enemies, ſtrong againſt temptations, patient in ſufferings; what it is makes them go on <hi>ſinging in the ways of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 138.1. <hi>and glorying in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Rom. 5.3. and remember that all this comfort you loſe, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo late e're you come into the way, wherein alone it is to be found.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Think what others,</hi> beſide your ſelves, <hi>loſe by your thus deferring your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Every Saint is a publick Good; the World is the better for him: But while you go on in ſin, and never think of repenting till the laſt, who is the better for you? nay, who are not loſers by you? Angels in Heaven loſe the joy they might have had in your Converſion; Miniſters loſe the comfort of being inſtrumental in it, your Families loſe the Inſtruction they might have had of you, your Neighbours the provocation they might have had to holineſs by your example; the wicked loſe the convictions they might have been brought under by the power of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs appearing in your converſation, Saints the comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they might have had by your Society, Diſcourſe, Experience, and all generally, what good they might have got by your Prayers; and, that which is more than all, doth not God loſe the glory you might have given him, had that time, that life and ſtrength been ſpent in his Service, which you have ſpent upon your Luſts!</p>
            <p>I need not tell you over again <hi>what you hazard;</hi> even your never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting at all; your being forſaken of God, given up to the Devil and your Luſts, and ſo having your hearts hardned, your minds blinded, your Conſciences ſeared, and your Souls in concluſion damned. If it be not ſo, no thanks to your ſelves. If God be merciful to you (and no body in this World knows whether he will or not) yet you do your part to bereave your ſelves of that mercy, and plunge your ſelves into the Abyſs of eternal miſery.</p>

Do you know what will be your minds two or three days hence, if not, how can you know twenty or thirty years before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand?
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40119:101"/> are you ſure you ſhall never meet with any accident, any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation that may change your mind? And if you do know your mind, what it will certainly be when you are dying, yet do you know what God's mind will be then, whether he will give you repentance when you ſet about it, and give you a pardon when you ſeek it? If you do know it, I pray, how came you by that knowledge? When did God tell you ſo, and where? In what text of Scripture hath he revealed it? where doth he promiſe you repentance, and pardon at the laſt, when you had never ſeriouſly ſought either all your days?</p>

You will make work for repentance now, and ſeek for repentance at laſt; offend God, and provoke him, and make work for pardoning mercy all your days, and then ſue to him for it. You will perſevere to affront the grace of Chriſt, and throw his blood back into his face, and then expect to be waſhed in it from your ſins, and ſaved by it when you go out of the World.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>To conclude.</hi> Take heed eſpecially of thoſe things which are the <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hinderances</hi> of a timely repentance.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Wrong notions of repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>an eaſie thing,</hi> and ſo may be done at any time; that it is but ſorrowing for ſin, and crying God mercy for having offended him. This prevails with too many, that know not wherein the nature of it conſiſts. Remember therefore that it is no eaſie thing to get a through change wrought in your hearts; to divorce your luſts to which you have been ſo long wedded, to part with thoſe ſins you love beſt, and engage in thoſe ways of ſtrict holineſs, which of all things in the World you hate moſt. The old Man will fight hard ere he die. The fleſh will never yield, and hardly be overcom. And if ever God work repentance to you, he will ſo work it as to make you work at it too, and labour after it, his grace uſing and employing your faculties. And what can you ever do either in ſeeking repentance before the infuſion of the grace, or exerciſing it when infuſed; but you will find ſin oppoſing you in it, and ſo creating difficulties in your work?</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is <hi>a ſour and an unpleaſant thing,</hi> made up of ſorrow and ſadneſs and unquietneſs of Spirit. They know no delights but ſenſual ones, and think if they part with the pleaſure of ſin, they part with the comfort of their lives. Do not therefore look meerly on the dark ſide of repentance, or what may make it ſeem uneaſie to you: look through it and you will find that which will make it more pleaſant. In the very ſorrow you fear, if it be right, <hi>i. e.</hi> godly ſorrow, there will be ſuch a mixture of Love, as will make it in a good meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to you. If it ſeem painful to you to ſtrive againſt ſin, and there be trouble in the combat, yet when you prevail over it you will find comfort in the Victory. You will be more pleaſed with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving denied your ſelves, than you could with having gratified your ſelves. Our Saviours promiſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> one would think ſhould reconcile you not only to any ſeeming trouble in the work of repentance, but to all the greateſt difficulties and ſeverities of the moſt ſtrict and mortified life. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed your repentance be meerly legal, proceeding from fear of wrath,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40119:102"/> or Popiſh, for the expiation of your ſins, I grant it may be a ſad and unpleaſant thing; but if it be a true Proteſtant repentance, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Evangelical one, mixed with Love to God, and proceeding from the Faith of Free Grace and remiſſion of ſin through the Blood of Chriſt, it need not be ſuch a ſcare-crow to you as to make you hazard your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by ſhifting your duty.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Preſumptuous thoughts of Gods mercy:</hi> that God may be merciful to them, and give them repentance and pardon their ſins at the very laſt. Conſider therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As merciful as God is, yet <hi>his will ſets bounds even to that infinite mercy as to the actings and outgoings of it,</hi> and beyond thoſe bounds it will never paſs. There is a <hi>time,</hi> a <hi>day,</hi> a <hi>now</hi> of grace, which when it is once over, no mercy will be ſhewn you. Offers of mercy, invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made to ſinners, and the acceptation of them are but for a time; the door is open but for a time, and when that is paſt it will be <hi>ſhut, Matth.</hi> 25.10. and all your calling and knocking will never prevail with God for the opening of it again. And what then ſhall you be the better, the nearer repentance, or nearer pardon for all that Ocean of mercy that is in God, if you ſeek it too late, and when he will not let out one drop of it to you?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods juſtice is as great as his mercy:</hi> All his Attributes are alike infinite, one doth not overtop the other. And then if you delay and put off repenting to your latter end, why may you not as reaſonably fear leſt he ſhould in juſtice puniſh you for your long impenitency, as in mercy give you repentance?</p>

Then he proceedeth to ſhew the Privileges of the adopted Children of God, that there is no condemnation due to them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made them free from the Law of Sin and Death; and that they are heirs of God,</hi> verſ. 17. which is more than all the World.

But as in time he choſe firſt the Jews, rejecting them he choſe the Gentiles, without any view of Merit or Eligibility in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them before others; for the Jews were the ſmalleſt and meaneſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40119:103"/> of all Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7. and the Gentiles all over-run with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Profaneneſs: Yet this Converſion of the Gentiles was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and therefore forewilled of God from the beginning, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18.

            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.8. He exhorteth them to owe no body any thing but Love; be in no bodies debt, yet owe every one Love; a debt always to be paying, and yet always owing; yet ſtill abiding our proper treaſure.</p>
            <p>This 14th Chapter is a branch of ſome particular Duties of Love, and this Verſe is the ſum of this whole Chapter of Charity; which words are ſaid to have occaſioned the Converſion or Confirmation of <hi>Alipius,</hi> as the foregoing words were of <hi>Auguſtines:</hi> Such is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority and Energy of the naked Word of God upon the Conſciences of Men, in the day of Chriſts Power. And the naked Sword cuts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than when it is ſheathed in a gaudy ſcabbard of the inticing words of Mans wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4,</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles were frequently exerciſed with difficulties, how to compoſe the differences among Chriſtians; the Jewiſh Converts were eager to bring their Circumciſion, with their obſervation of times and meats, along with them into Chriſtianity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. The Gentiles were not accuſtomed to theſe things, and therefore oppoſed them, yet were as ready to bring a Tang of their own old Errors with them alſo, as their Doctrin of Demons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and their worſhipping of Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. and probably ſome of their Heatheniſh Feſtivals and Cuſtoms: So that both parties were in an error, and neither of them fully underſtood that liberty Chriſt had brought to them from theſe beggerly Elements, Rudiments and Ordinances to which they were in bondage. For if God ſaw good to free his Church from thoſe Ceremonies which were inſtituted by himſelf, he would never allow them to be in a ſlaviſh ſubjection to the Superſtitions and Ceremonies of worldly Mens inventions, tho' never ſo Dogmatically and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially impoſed. For as Learned <hi>Davenant</hi> on that <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. obſerves, ſuch injunctions are apt to grow upon Men, forbidding firſt not to touch or eat ſuch and ſuch meats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then not to taſte, after not ſo much as to handle them.</p>
            <p>Now to compoſe theſe differences the Apoſtles met at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15.20. where they made no poſitive injunctions for the Chriſtians to practiſe any Ceremonies or Obſervations of either party againſt their Conſciences; but limited the exerciſe of their liberty, which they truly had by the Goſpel; but that they ſhould abſtain from Fornication, which to explain is too great a digreſſion, Blood, things Strangled, and what was offered to Idols. Theſe they would have them to avoid, that they may not offend thoſe weak Jews who could not ſuddenly
<pb facs="tcp:40119:104"/> concoct theſe practices, till Judgment ſhould be brought to Victory over theſe feeble fancies. And they laid this alſo as a burthen on them for a time, till they could be brought to better underſtanding; and all this by way of advice from the Apoſtles, Elders, and the whole Church, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. their Letter alſo was read to the whole multitude, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. So here the Apoſtle adviſeth the <hi>Romans,</hi> how to do in the like caſe with theſe weak ones, <hi>Him that is weak receive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is the deſcription of the perſon who is to be conſidered, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) not him that is weak and ſick to death, erring in the foundation of Faith; one who doth not hold the Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Who denieth the Lord who bought him;</hi> theſe are deſtructive Hereſies which bring on Men ſwift damnation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. we are not to ſay to ſuch <hi>God ſpeed you,</hi> 2 Epiſtle <hi>John</hi> 10. their very breath is blaſting to Mens minds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is it one who is ſick about queſtions, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.23. fooliſh, endleſs, unlearned, unedifying queſtions, which only ingender contention: ſuch are idle buſie-bodies, ſeekers, and diſputatious quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellers about ſome minute things, which hypocritical and vain minds Trade in, to keep themſelves buzzing about the borders of Religion, that they may keep off from the more ſerious duties, and ſubſtantial parts thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But he is one who is weak in the Faith, who though he hath embraced the Doctrin of our Saviour, yet is not of a mature concocted judgment, clear enough about the abolition of Ceremonial obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, things he judgeth ought to be forborn or done. Now let things be never ſo indifferent in the general, definition or Theſis; yet when they come to be uſed and exerciſed in their individual circumſtances they will be determinately good, or determinately evil, in all moral agents and actions. And that which in general ſeemeth indifferent to one is not ſo to another; theſe Gentiles could freely eat things ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but the Jews could not. Therefore it is a very ſtrong weakneſs or wilfulneſs in ſome who love to turn Straws into Trees, and Feathers into Birds, and not to leave things as Chriſt hath left them, and as they are in their own nature, but will tranſpeciate as others tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiate by their own breath in their own Opinions; and more fiercely contend for their own Laws than the commands of God, as <hi>Saul</hi> was more ſevere on <hi>Jonathan</hi> for taſting hony, than on himſelf for rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt Gods expreſs command. Theſe heats indicate an Hectick Fever to be in the body, preternatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>y eating up and preying on the vital heat, Love to God and our Neighbour; the zeal for Mens own Chimnies eateth up the Houſe of God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Here is the injunction of Charity towards weak ones (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) take them to you, receive them into your Houſes, uſe Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality towards them, ſupply their neceſſities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13. not mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent receptions, ſuch as <hi>Levi</hi> gave our Saviour (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>Luke</hi> 5.29. But when they fly for their Religion and Lives, ſupply their wants though they be not juſt of your ſize or Opinion, do not force
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40119:104"/> him to practiſe what he cannot freely do to buy your Charity; this is a dear purchaſe and a cruel ſale. Generous hoſpitality is a duty of another faſhion, receive them into your Arms, into your boſoms, into your Love and Converſe, that you may inſtruct them and win upon them, receive them into your Society, into your Communion, treat this weak Brother with all humility, condeſcention, love and kindneſs; yea, with all the warm graces Chriſtianity hath indued you with. Let not theſe leaſt differences cauſe the greateſt diſtances (as often they do) if he hath ſo much candor as he will be received, and be not ſullen and angry, receive him; and by ſtrength of Love, bear with him, and forbear him, till by Love you ſoften and overcome him, by heaping coals of fire upon his Head. For if he be weak, yet ſeriouſly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely a lover of Chriſt, and beloved of him, the Lord hath received him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. therefore do you alſo receive him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The limitation of this exception, <hi>not to doubtful Diſputations,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſome would render it <hi>diſcerning of thoughts,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. there was ſuch an extraordinary guift, <hi>as the diſcerning of Spirits.</hi> So there may be an ordinary prying into Mens thoughts, and what is <hi>Mark</hi> 9.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is <hi>Luke</hi> 5.22. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Jeſus ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their thoughts,</hi> and thoughts are but Mens dialoguing and diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with themſelves, and ſo the ſenſe it thus, <hi>Receive him, but not to the diſcerning or judging of his Opinion or Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>that he ſhould be hardened to judge others Thoughts to be altered becauſe they receive him.</hi> But receiving is, receiving him into their Society; therefore not receiving him muſt be not to ſomething which was apt to be in their Society and among them, which was not the diſcretion of the ſtrong, but their diſputes which were not fit for theſe weak ones. And the word moſt commonly ſignifies <hi>diſputing with others, Acts</hi> 19.9. <hi>Paul diſputed dayly in the School of</hi> Tyrannus. And <hi>Mark</hi> 9.34. The Diſciples <hi>diſputed who among them ſhould be greatest.</hi> But in <hi>Jude</hi> 9. both words are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Michael contending with the Devil, diſputed about the body of</hi> Moſes.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Chriſtians are to receive ſuch as are weak in the Faith, into their Hearts by Love, and not to trouble or heat their Heads with cramping diſputes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For practical Piety will ſooner rectifie the judgment of the weak, than fierce argumentations. Lay aſide this heat about Ceremonies on all Hands, and attend to Reading and Hearing the Word, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; Pray and Praiſe God together, and Converſe in holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Love to each others Souls; let but this fire live upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of your Hearts and then all other ſtrange fire and heats will die away.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will ſhew you that weak Chriſtians cannot well judge of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the practice of known duties is the way to get more light.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:105"/>3. That Chriſtian Love will ſooner win others from error than rigid Arguments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Inferences from all for Inſtruction and Direction.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, Diſputations and Arguments are not eaſily judged of by ſuch as are weak in Faith and Knowledge of Chriſtian liberty. Now this is evident from the firſt Diſpute that ever was in the World. For Satan was a Diſputer from the beginning, and is ſtill the Father and Author of all inſnaring and contentious Diſputations. The firſt thing he diſputed was Gods command. The Prohibition and Threatning was abſolute,<note place="margin">

But by this firſt diſpute with the Serpent, our firſt Parents, when in uprightneſs and ſtrength of the image of God new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtamped on them in knowledge and holineſs; yet this Father or fomenter of Diſputes foiled them; and ſo all mankind being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and federally in them, was drawn into their guilt and filth. So that reaſon is ever ſince debaſed and depoſed, and no Man is able to rule himſelf, much leſs another; his rule and meaſures being broken, he hath only ſome fragments and ſplinters of the Tree of Knowledge which he darts againſt God and himſelf: The holy Lamp and Flame is ſo extinguiſhed, that now he only compaſſeth himſelf about with his own ſparks till he lie down in ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. Creatures as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are fallible and failable (witneſs Men and Angels) eſpecially by the impulſe of falſe Arguments. It is God's only Prerogative to be intrinſecally Infallible and Immutable. And it is a perfection incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to Men or Angels. But now ſinful Man is in a much more dark and doleful ſtate. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He cannot form an Idea of any thing, nor frame a true notion of any thing as it is in it ſelf; but he conceives by the Air of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, Smilitudes and Phantaſms; he cannot ſee into things themſelves nor their Eſſences: He is hardly put to it to tell what dull Matter or Body is, much more what nimble forms, motion, or Spirits are, or what his own Soul is, though ſo nigh to him and part of himſelf: He is ſo in the dark he cannot define what light it ſelf is. If any be ſo confident as to think he knoweth any thing, our Apoſtle tells him, <hi>He knoweth nothing as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.2. <hi>He is not ſufficient as of himſelf for one good or true thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. which cuts the top ſinew of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> and the Champions of the power of Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His judgment therefore muſt needs be dubious or wrong whereby he is to compare things that differ or agree together. If God leave him or give him up to himſelf, the Prophet is a fool, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Man is mad, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.7. ſo as he will put darkneſs for light and light for darkneſs, bitter for ſweet and ſweet for bitter, call good evil and evil good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. Conſcience, the Souls taſter, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe is ſo vitiated and defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. that he hath no true judgment or diſcretion, having not his ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:40119:105"/>3. His concluſions therefore muſt needs be diſtorted from theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the Errors in the firſt and ſecond concoction are not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and amended by the third; he who cannot make one ſtrait ſtep can never take three together. All the Errors and Fallacies in the World are but the products of his Ratiocinations, <hi>viz.</hi> I can go to the Tavern or Exchange, I find therefore I can Repent and Believe when I will; whereas theſe are actions of another Life and Nature, which he was never born to, unleſs Regenerated by the Spirit of God; <hi>To Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Believe are God's gift, Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>His work in us,</hi> John 6.65. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Though for this very Doctrin many of his ignoranter Diſciples went back and walked no more with him,</hi> John 6.66. And ſo Men jog on in their ſenſuality, preſumptuouſly, as if there was ſomething in the pleaſures of ſin, which was ſweeter and dearer to them than God or Heaven; and when they have no more ſtrength to ſerve their Luſts, nor any thing elſe to do but to die, they can in one quarter of an hour make their peace with God, (as one of that herd ſaid to me, who ſoon after drawing Water out of his own Well, and being Drunk, was by the weight of the Bucket drawn into the Well and drown'd). Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, <hi>I may ſin becauſe Grace aboundeth,</hi> this is a moſt diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unnatural argument; I may hate God and my Saviour, becauſe he hath ſo loved me; when holy <hi>Herbert</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let me not Love thee, if I love thee not;</hi> love being ſtronger than Death or Hell, in the Hearts of Gods beloved ones. So <hi>without holineſs none ſhall ſee God,</hi> therefore we muſt be juſtified by our Evangelical Obedience and Righteouſneſs, whereas this is only a concomitant for the cauſe; for God pronounceth and declareth none to be Righteous, but ſuch as are Righteous; <hi>now there is none Righteous, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3.10. but in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>who of God is made Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Redemption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dav.</hi> de Juſt.</note> 1 Cor. 1.36. In ſound <hi>Davenant</hi>'s words, <hi>An Alderman ſits in the Court not becauſe he is to come in his Gown, but becauſe he is an Alderman by Election,</hi> &amp;c. So you muſt obey the Laws of the Church, if that wedge will drive, if not the Laws of the State, both which are inconſequent if they be not according to the Law of God; the eſtabliſhing perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by a Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.20. made neither <hi>Davids</hi> nor Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the worſe, but their ſin the greater who twiſted ſuch a Law. So that we need a new Logick from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the Eternal Word, as a directory to our Reaſonings, as well as the common Logick which teacheth us the regulation of the operations of our minds.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As we are lame in our Feet by our Naturals, ſo even thoſe who by the light of the Goſpel and Grace are brought over to better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet by vertue of the old craſineſs they are not throughly illuminated and refined. The very Apoſtles themſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.34. were plainly told by our Saviour, <hi>that he ſhould ſuffer Death, and riſe again the third day,</hi> yet they underſtood none of theſe things; theſe ſayings were hid from them, until he opened their underſtandings to underſtand the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45. We have all a dark ſide, and <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>We know but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. we ſee but one ſide of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:106"/> the Globe, we cannot view things round about, they are above our Hemiſphere. Theſe weak Jews were Zealous for their Ceremonies as being inſtituted by God, the Gentiles as hot for theirs; let no Man think himſelf infallible, for theſe were all out and miſtaken. Form, Cuſtom and Education do wonderfully confirm Men in Error: How hardly were People in our firſt Reformation drawn from their Prayers in Latin to Engliſh, yet they underſtood not Latin? as hardly would they ſtill be weaned from little formalities, though it were to entertain the moſt real and reaſonable ſervice in the World. So great a Tyrant is tough cuſtom over Phlegmatick Souls; ſo apt are Men to heats for trifles, by which Straw and Stubble they turn the Church into a Brick-kiln.</p>
            <p>Theſe Jews had Divine Right to plead, and the uſage and practice of all the ſeed of the Faithful, enough to ſtagger a weak Chriſtian; Errors fairly ſet off may paſs for Truths, and if but weakly confuted may hang a doubt in Mens minds: ſo Truths ill guarded may go for Errors; objections not well cleared had better never have been ſtarted, for they may puzzle a weak Head and Heart, and make them both ake with fear of miſtakes. A Sophiſtical Diſputant will prove there is no Motion, the beſt way to confute him is in our Saviours words, <hi>riſe up and walk,</hi> John 5.8. which is a real ſilent demonſtration of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Nothing ſo convulſeth Mens reaſon as intereſt, as <hi>Hobs</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though there is no Problem in Mathematicks more demonſtrable than that all ſtrait Lines drawn from the Center to the Circumference are equal, yet if this did but croſs any Mans intereſt it would be diſputed.</hi> Now 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. the Apoſtle reduceth the whole World to thoſe three Elements, <hi>the luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the pride of Life;</hi> a threefold cord, ſtrong enough to pull any Truth in pieces, as eaſily as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his Wyths.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The luſt of the Fleſh, <hi>modo hic ſit bene,</hi> pleaſing the Fleſh goeth a great deal further than the Monks Bellies, who yet have a luſty ſhare in it; as one of their own ſaid, <hi>They had all things ſo complacent, that they wanted only a Vicar to go to Hell for them when they ſhould die.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Kitchin and Purgatory mutually ſupport one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Diſorders of Life hold up Celibacy in Men in Orders. The luſt of Idleneſs inviteth to Stage-plays, the nurſeries of Vanity and Vice; to Cards and Dice, in defiance of that Canon which pronounceth them unlawful Games. A luſty Dinner makes the Veins ſo ſtrut, they can leap or fly to Heaven by their Free-will, without the neceſſity of Free-grace, ſo ſtrong is Fleſh and Blood without the Spirit of God. Sure he who hath an Immortal Soul within him, and a Dubious State to himſelf, as that dreadful Eternity before him, ſhould never be ſick of his time that lies upon his Hand, one hour whereof millions of Wolds can't redeem.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Covetouſneſs is a weighty Argument: Thouſands are enough to break the Loyns of moſt Mens minds, too heavy for the back of the ſtrongeſt Rationaliſt in the World; the Scale of Judgment cannot turn
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40119:106"/> while this beam is in the Eye, nor any Argument counterpoiſe this dead and deadly weight; but Tythe, Mint and Cummin, will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh Faith and the Love of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.42. St. <hi>Briget</hi> propheſied,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox</hi>'s Martyr.</note> 
               <hi>The Roman Clergy would ruin the Church by their avarice,</hi> for ſhe ſaid, <hi>They had already reduced the Ten Commands to two words,</hi> da pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Pride of Life ſwells Men till they break all bonds and bounds, like Stum in the Cask makes all the Hoops fly off. The zeal of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and having declared for a way, makes Men they cannot retreat; but will ſpur on for honour and profit, though the Angel of the Lord oppoſe them, till they are cruſhed to the Wall. If Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be founded in Self-denyal, Mortification, and bearing the Croſs, they who ſeek their own glory are not of God, <hi>John</hi> 7.18. that is either no Goſpel, or theſe certainly are no Diſciples of Chriſt. We had need look to ourſelves, for this luſt of domination and glory, as <hi>Charon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is the very Shirt of the Soul, on from the firſt, but laſt put off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I am to ſhew you that the practice of holy Duties clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded, is the ready way to have our minds inlightned in the knowledge of Principles: Reading the Scriptures, diſcourſing about Heaven, and about their Souls everlaſting welfare; <hi>Reproving one another, and admoniſhing,</hi> Rom. 15.14. <hi>comforting and ſupporting the weak and dejected Soul,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. <hi>To exhort one another dayly, leſt any be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3.13. Duties ſo much out of faſhion in theſe days, that it is not counted good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or civility to practiſe them; friendly reproof is eſteemed want of good breeding. But are they not ſtrange Chriſtians who are ſtrangers to Scripture Duties?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe Practical Duties performed would give us light, <hi>He that doth the Truth cometh to the light,</hi> John 3.21. not only out of boldneſs but diſcovery of knowledge; Truth is nothing but goodneſs explained, and goodneſs is nothing but Truth conſolidated. Rudiments of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are prerequiſite to practice, but examples clear all things to us. Demonſtration by the Compaſſes maketh the Maxim evident. He that doth beſt, knoweth beſt, for he ſeeth the actions as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and circumſtances, he doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.130. <hi>(pethac pethaiim)</hi> the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the command giveth light, the Door is a Window to him that hath a weak ſight; even thoſe things Men have formerly ridiculed, practice hath reconciled them to be their <hi>Diana</hi> and great delight. As the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> in <hi>Clem. Alex.</hi> who could not taſte lewdneſs till he was in all evil, as tis <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.14. <hi>If wicked practices darken the mind</hi> (as all the works of darkneſs do) <hi>than holy actions illuminate the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The exerciſe of holy Duties advanceth light; every ſtep a Man takes he goeth into a new Horizon, and gets a further proſpect into Truth. Motion is promoted by motion, actions breed habits, habits fortifie the powers, the new life grows ſtronger and fuller of Spirit.
<pb facs="tcp:40119:107"/> The yoke of Chriſt is eaſier, ſmoother and lighter, by often wearing it; <hi>this anoints us with the oyl of gladneſs, and makes the ways of Wiſdom pleaſantneſs,</hi> Prov. 3.17. Life and light are nearly related, <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>The life was the light of Men,</hi> Acts 1.1. <hi>Theſe things Jeſus firſt did, then taught, and ſo he was mighty in Deed and in Word,</hi> Luke 24.19. very airing and motion heateth to a flame, <hi>this made his light burn,</hi> verſ. 32. <hi>and ſhine too.</hi> Truth incarnate, in action, ſeems a lively reſemblance of God in fleſh; the unfolding a doubt to another, hath often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and reſolved it to the proponent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If any be in danger of Error, or got into an ill way, keeping up warm Duties, Meditation and Prayer will keep him in, or help him out; communion with the Saints is an admirable antidote againſt ſin or Error. As in a Team of Horſes if one laſh out of the way; if the other hold their courſe they will draw the former to the right path, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. <hi>ye have an unction, and ye know all things;</hi> when there are Antichriſts and great Apoſtacies, keeping to Duty, like keeping the Road, preſerveth us from by-paths. I remember a Snowy night when many wandring homeward were frozen to death; A Shepherd feeling himſelf foiled, by often falling, ſet down his Crook in one point and beat a path round, and ſo preſerved his life and kept him out of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices and ditches. And we have a promiſe of light, <hi>if we preſs to the mark and prize of our high calling,</hi> Phil. 3.15. carry the Goale in your Eye and it will direct you a path where there is none upon a plain. Sincerely aim at Gods glory, and your Souls ſalvation, and you ſhall not miſs your way. If in any thing you ſhould miſs it, and be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, <hi>God will reveal even this unto you.</hi> Yea, our great Lord and Maſter aſſureth us, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>He that doth the will of God, he ſhall know the Doctrin, whether it be of God, or I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> But if Men will make bold with God and Conſcience, and act for their own ends and glory, they rob God of his ſupremacy, and will loſe both their way and their end. He that walketh uprightly hath God for his guard and guide, with devout <hi>Zachary</hi> he is within the Vail, and if he be in a miſtake God will reveal it to him: <hi>For the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will make them know his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. Go to thy Oracle and pray, and a ray of heavenly light ſhall direct you, as the Wiſe-mens Star, to the holy Jeſus; <hi>their minds are Gods candles, Prov.</hi> 20.27. and as Father of Lights, he will light them when they approach him with ardent ſupplication.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I am to ſhew that Chriſtian charity and reception will ſooner win weak ones to the Truth, than rigid Arguments, for ſo the Apoſtle adviſeth them who were to deal with people weak in Faith and ſtrongly zealous for Ceremonies, diſpute not with them but receive them firſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard oppoſition breeds oppoſitions; a Man will never believe that he Loves his Soul, who cuts his purſe, belies his actions, torments his Body. Paſſion begets paſſion, but love only kindles love; when Men do hotly Diſpute they joſtle for the way, and ſo one or both muſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40119:107"/> needs leave the path of Truth and Peace. The Saw of contention reciprocated, with its keen teeth eateth up both Truth and Love. For ſuch contentions are rather for Victory than Truth. Now paſſion doth nothing well, which made one Emperor ſay over his Alphabet to get the Dominion over his anger; <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> fann'd himſelf in his Garden, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.7. and he in <hi>Plutarch</hi> would not ſmite his Servant becauſe he was angry. Paſſionated perſecution makes only Hypocrites become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites; and in their Breaſts alſo lodge ſuch a revenge as will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one time or another, upon them who have made them offer violence to their Conſciences. Religion is a free choice upon judgment, or 'tis not Religion, therefore it gets in by perſwaſion, not perſecution. Yet 'tis ſtrangely true, they who are ſo tender of their own Wills, that God muſt not touch them unleſs by Argument, yet laxate themſelves to Club Law with their Brethren, not content with a moral ſwaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Loving converſe taketh off thoſe prejudices which hinder Mens minds from a true knowledge of others Principles and Practices; which at a diſtance ſeem horrid and monſtrous Opinions and Practices, when as a little free converſe with them breedeth quite other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. The Papiſts picture the Proteſtants as bruits with Tails, as Devils with Horns, to terrifie the Vulgar; but knowing Merchants dare truſt them: So ſome Proteſtants have repreſented the Puritans as Peſtilent and Seditious perſons, as Mad and having a Devil, as the Scribes and Phariſees did <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt; but the plain hearted people ſaw thorough thoſe pious frauds and tricks, and were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their Doctrin and Life, when they healed Souls and Bodies on the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sincere love and converſe breedeth a good opinion of perſons who differ from us; they can taſte humility, meekneſs and kindneſs better than the more ſpeculative Principles of Religion. Theſe get into Mens affections, and ſo bore away into their judgments, and cauſe them to alter their minds. Two Heads, like two Globes, touch but in one point, the whole Bodies at a diſtance; but two Hearts touch <hi>in plano,</hi> and fall in with each other in all points. Love openeth the Heart and Ear to cooler conſideration and ſecond thoughts. The Spirit of God direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.12. not in the ſtrong Wind which rent Rocks and Mountains, nor in the Earthquake or Fire, but in the ſilent whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or tranquil voice.</p>
            <p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction, How to carry our ſelves towards them who are weak in the Faith, in theſe days, and doubtleſs it is a ſickly ſeaſon when there are ſo many feveriſh heats among us.</hi> I will not ſay, what once a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>That theſe are the</hi> ſpuria vitulamina, <hi>the Baſtard frisks of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighths days;</hi> But I rather think the violent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after External Uniformity without the Inward, the ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the induſtrious Bees in one Hive, was a great cauſe of their caſtling into ſeveral Swarms. Threſhing the Corn hath driven it out of the Floor, and the graſping ſo hard the Granes, all into the Hands and Power of ſome, hath made them creep out through their Fingers.
<pb facs="tcp:40119:108"/> Rigid Impoſitions, and violent Proſecutions and Exactions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to things <hi>extra</hi> Scriptural and Divine Inſtitution, and without any manifeſt tendency to Edification, have and will make fractions without end. As <hi>D. W.</hi> ſaid, <hi>Till Men be Infallible, and the World Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, moderation becometh every Man who is in his ſenſes and conſidereth himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome who have all Faith, believe incredibly, as that <hi>Katharina Senenſis,</hi> praying for a new Heart, ſhe had her real Heart cut out of her Body, and after ſome days had a new Heart formed by Chriſt, put into her. That making a croſs on the Body with a Finger driveth the Devil away. That a Prieſt by theſe words, <hi>this is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> tranſubſtantiateth the Bread into the Body of Chriſt, and ſo he offereth that Sacrifice to deliver Souls out of Priſon; and then by his Dirges conducteth them to Paradiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others have no Faith at all, as that Infallible one who ſaid, <hi>What vaſt Wealth hath this Fable of Chriſt acquired to the Church!</hi> So when ſome had Diſputed about the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> moſt gravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a Verſe,
<q>Et redit in nihilum quod fuit ante nihil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which is nothing muſt needs come to nothing.</hi> And I fear there are more Atheiſts than Papiſts, who ſeem to believe all on the Stage, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their retiring thoughts. We are not bound to receive ſuch into our Boſoms or Communion, leſt we ſting our own Breaſts; out of charity to our Souls we muſt take heed of receiving ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But there are others who ſeem ſeriouſly to believe the Doctrin of the Goſpel, yet have a weakneſs in their judgments about little things. Theſe we muſt receive and inſtruct them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is not in Meat or Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Shew them all kindneſs, pity them, pray for them, and let them ſee, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Nothing but your order, and the ſtedfaſtneſs of your Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Stand faſt and fix'd in the good Word of God, <hi>which is ſetled for ever in Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119.89. as the Copy of the Divine Nature and Law. <hi>Stand having your Loins girt about with Truth,</hi> Epheſ. 6.14. <hi>and having on the Breaſtplate of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is the grand and perfect rule of Faith, Worſhip and Life. Keep within theſe Trenches and you have an aſſurance of protection. I know no other method poſſible to Peace but in an univerſal reſolution to impoſe nothing upon others but what Chriſt himſelf hath impoſed, what Scripture commands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Teach Men to obſerve whatever I have commanded you, and then I am with you to the end of the World.</hi> This is a Miniſter of Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and he cannot look for Chriſt to be with him, if he go either co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let us therefore, in the Name of God, beg his holy Spirit, whom Chriſt hath promiſed, <hi>and that he ſhall lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth,</hi> John 16.13. He is the only infallible Interpreter of Gods
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40119:108"/> mind, <hi>He ſhall take of mine,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>and ſhew it unto you,</hi> verſ. 14. Then read the Scriptures as Chriſt himſelf did, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. <hi>his cuſtom was, he went into the Synagogue, on the Sabbath day, and ſtood up for to read, and when the Book of God was delivered to him,</hi> he read the 61 of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> a Propheſie of himſelf, and ſo he cloſed the Book and gave it to the Miniſter; then he expounded and applied it to the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <hi>That he came to preach to the poor, heal the broken hearted, give deliverance to the captives, open the Eyes of the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed.</hi> Oh bleſſed pattern for every Miniſter of Chriſt to follow! And ſing the Pſalms or Hymns, as we read he alſo did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30. and the Ancient Chriſtians, as <hi>Euſcbius</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſed early to ſing Pſalms and Praiſe to Chriſt, Adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the very words of Chriſt:</hi> But guard the Door that the groſly ignorant and profane may not come in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. If any degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſo, as firſt and ſecond admonition reclaim not, ſhut the Door up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>Let him be to you as an Heathen or a Publican,</hi> for ſo is the rule of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. Every Natural Body, and Civil Body, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, hath a power to take in or caſt out, ſuch as are for the Benefit or Damage of the Community, to Infranchiſe or Disfranchiſe when there is juſt cauſe. The Church is Chriſts Body, and a Society of viſible Saints. Moſt Epiſtles to the Churches in Scripture were directed to the Saints at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 1.7. at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 1.2. and ſo on. Now if out of Cuſtom, carnal Policy, Flattery, or other ill motive, the whole World muſt come into the Church, and the Church and the World (<hi>which lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 John 5.19.) are one thing; then in cometh alſo the god of this World too, And will Chriſt have fellowſhip with Devils? If Swearers, Drunkards, and Unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come in, it may be a Market-houſe, or Houſe for Merchants, but not the Lords-houſe, <hi>John</hi> 2.16. A Drunken Saint, an Unclean Saint, a Swearing Saint, if they be not contradictions, yet they ſound very harſhly. No ſin hath leſs tentation of gain or pleaſure than Swearing and Curſing, and no ſin more debaucheth the Conſcience, and ſtrips it even to Atheiſm of all reverence; and for Men to have no more pity on them than to let them cram damnation down their Throats, as ſoon as they have made the imprecation on themſelves is dreadful. I remember an Ear-witneſs told me, he heard Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> preach before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when his Affairs were at a low ebb, and he told him, <hi>While God-dam-me led the Van, and the Devil confound me brought up the Rear, he would be routed in all his deſigns.</hi> And they are very unlikely to be good Subjects to Princes who are open Rebels to the Laws of God and Men, and their own reaſon. But let us keep to the Rule, the Principles of Chriſts Kingdom are Rock and Steel, not calculated for the ſoft Meridians of this World, but can abide and ſtand in all times the ſame; they need not load the ſecular Arm to hold them up. Let us be faithful Executors of our Lords Will, not Law-makers or Teſtament-makers, for untempered Morter will be always falling and fowling them who daub it up. <hi>Let us therefore ſtand faſt in
<pb facs="tcp:40119:109"/> that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free;</hi> he and his Truth only can make us free from all Errors and miſtakes, <hi>John</hi> 8.36. <hi>Let us be of the ſame mind which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 2.5. then nothing will be done out of contention or vain-glory. But God will make good his own Promiſe, <hi>all his ſhall have one Heart and one way,</hi> Jer. 32.39. then our Lords Prayer ſhall be anſwered, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That all his may be one, as he and his Father are One.</hi> One in the World, that is impoſſible; but let them be one in us, in our appointments, <hi>and then the World will believe that thou haſt ſent me;</hi> otherwiſe Diviſions will breed ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as if Chriſtianity was no reality. Now what can any Man ſay againſt this method? Who are they that make Diviſions, but they that make more Duties in Religion and Worſhip than Chriſt hath made? They who build upright on the foundations, or they who will jet over and drop upon their Neighbours?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we ſhould keep to our rule, ſo practiſe accordingly; let the one Foot of the Compaſs keep the Center, and the other walk the rounds; let us live ſo as M. <hi>Felix</hi> ſays, <hi>Non magna loquimur, ſed vivimus;</hi> We do not talk great things but live them. Exact walking would be as a miracle in this looſe age, to confirm the Faith we do profeſs; Catechize your Children and Servants, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>to walk in the way of the Lord;</hi> ſo moſt excellent <hi>Theophilus</hi> was Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized and inſtructed in the things of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.4. Pray in your Families; dayly bread you have twice at leaſt, then you are directed to dayly prayer for it. If Nations and Kingdoms have Gods wrath poured out upon them that call not on his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.6. then ſurely Families much leſs can eſcape. We and our Families need dayly Grace, dayly Pardon as well as dayly Bread; therefore unleſs we dare die in our Sins we ſhould dayly pray; for in Gods hands is our breath, and his are all our ways, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.23. who then dare breath a day without compaſſing him about with Prayer and Praiſes? And <hi>let us adorn our Profeſſion of Godlineſs with honeſty,</hi> Tit. 2.10. 1 Tim. 2.2. Labour to think as near to the truth of things and actions as you can, and as they are in themſelves, <hi>Job</hi> 26.3. then ſpeak and declare the thing as it is in your mind, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 14.7. then do as you ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſimplifie your ſelf, in <hi>Epictetus</hi>'s phraſe, from all compoſition of Frauds, Policies and Hypocriſie; then beſure you be juſt and do as you would have others do to you, the grand skale of Righteouſneſs; if Men would but weigh their Thoughts, Words and Actions by this ſtandard of equity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. how would this make Miniſters, Lawyers, Phyſicians, and all others, take as much care of Peoples Souls, Bodies and Eſtates as of their own? then would come that golden age wherein they would have, if not ſo many dirty Fees, yet a cleaner and a greater reward of Peace of Conſcience and joy in God. Let us all be humble, meek, and patient, as our Lord, modeſt in Apparel, and all civil Converſation, as thoſe that reſolve to walk in Chriſt as they have received him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. and to wear him as they have put him on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. This Primitive ſimplicity would revive charity,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40119:109"/> which is frozen to pieces in this cold Age, this being the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. All the commands of God muſt needs be broken, by the very want of it. When all is done live ſo accurately, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. as if you were to be juſtified by your works; and then as unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servants caſt your ſelves wholly on Free-grace in Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. leaſt by the conceit of any merit, when you have anointed our Saviours feet, you fling the box at his Head, and rob him of his Prieſtly Office and Crown.</p>
            <p>As for diſputing of Controverſies, let your diſcourſes be rather in private, than before others, that you argue in Love to the Souls of your Brethren, not for Victory and Triumphing over their infirmities. The Jewiſh Rabbins ſay, <hi>He deſerveth Hell-fire who putteth his Brother to the bluſh.</hi> Therefore in meekneſs of Wiſdom argue with your week Brethren, that Chriſt was faithful in Gods Houſe or Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. in commanding all things neceſſary for Salvation, and the Worſhiping of God in Spirit and Truth; that <hi>Paul</hi> had declared to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> all the counſel of God, and kept back nothing that was profitable to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 27. therefore we may ſafely venture in this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and that thoſe Men who will venture to tender God a Worſhip which he hath not commanded, they take upon them to be wiſer than God, Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and can tell what will pleaſe God, better than himſelf can. If with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.33. they will ſet up a Worſhip of their own deviſing, to keep up his Golden Calves; they muſt have very low thoughts of God, as if he was taken with our voluntary humility, in fancies and poſtures, rather than the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity as it is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. when he hath told us, <hi>the words his Father had given him, he had given to his Diſciples,</hi> John 17.8. all other Traditions may very ſafely be rejected.</p>
            <p>Yet neither muſt we altogether abandon all Diſputations, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our indeed never called for a Sword but to cut his way to a Miracle, but remit them to the Schools or the Preſs: Honeſt Men may wear Swords, and learn to uſe them, becauſe Robbers ride armed. But let ſuch take heed they diſpute not with God, his Providence or Grace. I remember a Diſputation publickly in the Schools, where the Reſpondent in Divinity defended this Queſtion, <hi>That the term of a Man's life was moveable,</hi> he was preſently ſeized with a Fever and died. I ſay not, that Providence determined the Queſtion. But if all times, much more ours, are in Gods hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7. not our own, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.8. When <hi>Ames</hi> was invited to be Profeſſor at <hi>Franeker, Epiſcopius</hi> then at <hi>Leyden,</hi> in his Lectures in the Schools, read againſt <hi>Ames,</hi> who hearing of it, ſent a bold Challenge, <hi>That he would come to</hi> Leyden, <hi>and before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity anſwer</hi> Epiſcopius<hi>'s arguments, and oppoſe his determinations, if he pleaſed:</hi> I know not why Truth may not be as bold as Error. But <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> wiſely refuſed and declined it, knowing that <hi>Ames</hi> had a Scholaſtical Head, and cloſe Arguments would rout looſe Harangues, his Fiſt would be too hard for his Palm: Thoſe Doctrins are born up in the World by looſneſs of manners; they who are ſo much for Free-will,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:110"/> are for Free-life too. Never more of that Doctrin, and never more licentiouſneſs, which argueth ſome kindred and relation to be betwixt them. But as D. <hi>H.</hi> hath ſaid of Old, <hi>If</hi> Arminians <hi>be not the moſt godly, holy, heavenly, every way the beſt of Men, they are the very worſt, ſince they aſſert they have ſo much power to be good.</hi> Sir <hi>W. T.</hi> obſerves where this Opinion was born, it was looked upon as a midway betwixt Papiſts and Proteſtants, the Blew to that Bow-die. But I am ſure Gods Word ſays, <hi>He works in us to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. and the Tenth Article is expreſly againſt this Doctrin of Free-will.</p>
            <p>When Free-will and Wit have got the Aſcendant over true Reaſon and Conſcience, Satan will ride Poſt his laſt Stage: for they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Men into Foxes and Wolves, to deceive and devour each other, yea into Devils to torment and inſult over one anothers miſeries. And whoever above ground will build upon theſe ſelf-centered Globes, ſhall find their foundation will ſoon roll and ſlide from under them. When the Earth was corrupt then came the Flood of Waters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.13. Chriſtendom is ſo corrupted from true Chriſtianity, that theſe Giants in wickedneſs and violence preſage a deluge of Blood. <hi>But if when the Son of Man cometh he ſhall find no Faith on the Earth,</hi> then his coming is near. Then come Lord Jeſus, and put an end to all violence, fraud and wickedneſs, and ſhut up Hell in Hell, Hypocrites and Devils in the ſame Cloyſters, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.51. and gather thy Saints together to Worſhip thee in the beauty of Holineſs. Be thou the deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of all Nations, build thy own <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (for Men can't or will not) and appear in thy glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.2. ſhine in it as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Beauty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.2. make it an habitation of Juſtice, and a mountain of Holineſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.23. and a City of Truth, that it may be ſaid, <hi>Jehovah Shamma, the Lord is there,</hi> and hath the third time whipped the Traders out of his Temple, and ſet it upon everlaſting Foundations; all Adminiſtrations being according to his own meaſure, that Golden Rule, and the pattern in the Mount.</p>

               <q>How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Text is the Record of <hi>Joſeph's</hi> innocence and victory, Conſecrated in Scripture for the honour and imitation of that excellent Saint in ſucceeding Ages. He had been tryed by ſharp afflictions, the conſpiring envy of his Brethren, and the cruel effects of it, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and ſervitude, <hi>and poſſeſt his Soul in patience:</hi> here, he was encounter'd by a more dangerous temptation in another kind, and preſerv'd his integrity. Adverſity excites the Spirit to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious recollection, arms it with reſolution to endure the aſſaults, and ſtop the entrance of what is afflicting to nature: pleaſure by gentle inſinuations relaxes the mind to a looſe ſecurity, ſoftens and melts the Heart, and makes it eaſily receptive of corrupt impreſſions.</p>
            <p>Now to repreſent the Grace of God that preſerved <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance and efficacy, we muſt conſider the ſeveral circumſtances that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the difficulty of the double Victory, over the Tempter and himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Tempter, <hi>his Miſtreſs,</hi> who had deveſted the native modeſty of the bluſhing Sex, and by her Careſſes and blandiſhments ſought to draw him to compliance with her deſires. Her ſuperiour quality might ſeem to make her requeſt have the force of a Command over him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Sollicitation, <hi>lye with me.</hi> There are no ſins to which there is a ſtronger inclination in our corrupted nature, than to acts of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality. The temptation was heighten'd by the lure of profit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d advancement, that he might obtain by her favour, and intereſt in her Husband, who was an eminent Officer in the Egyptian Court:<note place="margin">Regeramus ipſae crimen, atque ultro impiam Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem arguamus: ſcelere velan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt ſcelus. <hi>Senec. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus.</hi>
               </note> and the denial would be extreamly provoking, both in reſpect it ſeem'd to be a Contempt injurious to her Dignity, and was a diſappointment of her ardent expectation. Hatred and revenge upon refuſal, are equal to the luſt of <hi>an imperious whoriſh Woman.</hi> We read the effects of it, in this Chapter; for upon his rejecting her deſires, rapt up with rage; and to purge her ſelf, ſhe turn'd his accuſer, wounded his reputation,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:111"/> depriv'd him of his liberty, and expos'd his life to extream peril. <hi>Joſeph</hi> choſe rather to lie in the duſt than to riſe by ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Opportunity was ready, and the object preſent: 'tis ſaid, <hi>there was none of the Men of the Houſe within.</hi> She had the advantage of ſecrecy to faſten the temptation upon him. When a ſin may be eaſily committed, and eaſily conceal'd, the reſtraints of fear and ſhame are taken off, and every breath of a temptation is ſtrong enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Carnally minded. The pureſt and nobleſt Chaſtity is from a principle of Duty within, not conſtrain'd by the apprehenſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and ſeverity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Continuance of the temptation: <hi>ſhe ſpake to him day by day.</hi> Her Complexion was luſt and impudence, and his repeated denials were ineffectual to quench her incenſed deſires, the black fire that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her mind. <hi>She caught him by the garment, ſaying, Lye with me:</hi> ſhe was ready to proſtitute her ſelf, and raviſh him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Perſon tempted, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in the flower of his age, the ſeaſon of ſenſuality, when innumerable by the force and ſwing of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eir vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appetites are impell'd to break the holy Law of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. His Repulſe of the temptation was ſtrong and pere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tory: <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs?</hi> He felt no ſympathy, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſenſual tenderneſs, but expreſt an impoſſibility of conſenting to her guilty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. We have in <hi>Joſeph</hi> exemplified that property of the Regenerate, <hi>He that is born of God cannot ſin:</hi> by a ſacred potent inſtinct in his breſt, he is preſerved not only from the conſummate acts, but recoils from the firſt offers to it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Reaſons are ſpecified of his rejecting her polluting motion. <hi>Behold my Maſter knows not what is with me in the Houſe, and he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all that he hath to my Hands, there is none greater in his Houſe than I, neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, becauſe thou art his Wife; How then can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> 'Twas a complicated crime of injuſtice and uncleanneſs: a moſt injurious violation of the ſtrongeſt tyes of duty and gratitude to his Maſter, and of the ſacred marriage Covenant to her Husband, and the fouleſt blot to their perſons: Therefore <hi>how can I commit a ſin</hi> ſo contrary to natural Conſcience, and ſupernatural grace, and provoke God? Thus I have briefly conſidered the narrative of <hi>Joſephs</hi> temptation, and that Divine grace preſerved him unſpotted from that contagious fire, may be reſembled to the miraculous preſerving the three <hi>Hebrew</hi> Martyrs unſinged, in the midſt of the flaming furnace. The patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and the Chaſtity of <hi>Joſeph</hi> are tranſmitted by the Secretaries of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, to be in perpetual remembrance and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>From this ſingular inſtance of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was neither ſeduced by the allurements of his Miſtriſs, nor terrified by the rage of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd affection to ſin againſt God: I ſhall obſerve two general Points.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:40119:111"/>I. <hi>That temptations to ſin how alluring ſoever, or terrifying, ought to be rejected with abhorrenc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the fear of God is a ſure defence and guard againſt the ſtrongeſt temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will explain and prove the firſt, and only ſpeak a little of the ſecond in a branch of the Application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That temptations to ſin how alluring ſoever, or terrifying, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with abhorrence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There will be Convincing proof of this, by conſidering two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſin in its Nature, preſcinding from the train of woful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is the greateſt Evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Relatively to us, it is the moſt pernicious deſtructive Evil.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſin conſidered in it ſelf is the greateſt Evil. This will be evident by conſidering the general Nature of it, as directly oppoſite to God the ſupreme good. The definition of ſin expreſſes its eſſential Evil; <hi>'tis the tranſgreſſion of the Divine Law,</hi> and conſequently oppoſes the rights of Gods Throne, and obſcures the Glory of his Attributes that are exercis'd in the Moral Government of the World. God as Creator <hi>is our King, our Lawgiver and Judge.</hi> From his propriety in us ariſes his juſt title to Sovereign Power over us:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.</note> 
               <hi>Know ye that the Lord he is God, 'tis he that made us, not we our ſelves, we are his people and the Sheep of his paſture.</hi> The Creatures of a lower order, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of diſtinguiſhing between Moral Good and Evil, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the weight of Nature to what is merely ſenſible, and therefore are uncapable of a Law to regulate their choice. But Man who is endowed with the powers of Underſtanding and Election, to conceive and chooſe what is Good, and reject what is Evil, is govern'd by a Law, the declared will of his Maker: accordingly a Law the rule of his Obedience, was written in his Heart.</p>
            <p>Now ſin the tranſgreſſion of this Law, contains many great Evils?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin is a Rebellion againſt the Sovereign Majeſty of God, that gives the life of Authority to the Law. Therefore Divine Precepts are enforced with the moſt proper and binding motives to obedience, <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> He that with purpoſe and pleaſure commits ſin, impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly renounces his dependance upon God, as his Maker and Governor, over-rules the Law, and arrogates an irreſponſible licenſe to do his own will. This is expreſt by thoſe Atheiſtical deſigners, <hi>who ſaid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> i2.4.</note> 
               <hi>With our Tongue we will prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us.</hi> The Language of Actions that is more natural and convincing than of Words, declares that ſinful Men deſpiſe the Commands of God, as if they were not his Creatures and Subjects. What a diſhonour, what a diſpleaſure is it to the God of glory, that proud duſt ſhould fly in his Face, and controule his Authority?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20.</note> 
               <hi>He has ten thouſand times ten thouſand Angels that are high in dignity, and excel in ſtrength, waiting in a poſture
<pb facs="tcp:40119:112"/> of reverence and obſervance about his Throne, ready to do his will:</hi> How provoking is it for a deſpicable Worm to contravene his Law, and lift his Hand againſt him? It will be no excuſe to plead the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Men for ſin: for as much as God is more glorious than Men, ſo much more are his Commands to be reſpected and obeyed than Mens. When there is an evident oppoſition between the Laws of Men and of God, we muſt diſobey our Superiours tho' we diſpleaſe them, and obey our Supreme Ruler. He that does what is forbidden, or neglects to do what is Commanded by the Divine Law, to pleaſe Men, tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the higheſt Sovereignty on Earth, is guilty of double wickedneſs: of impiety in debaſing God, and idolatry in deifying Men.</p>
            <p>It is an extreme aggravation of this Evil, in that ſin as it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming our homage to God, ſo 'tis in true account a yielding ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Devil. For, ſin is in the ſtricteſt propriety <hi>his work.</hi> The original rebellion in Paradiſe was by his temptation, and all the actual and habitual ſins of Men ſince the fall, are by his efficacious influence. <hi>He darkens the carnal mind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</note> and ſways the polluted will, he excites and inflames the vicious affections,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2.</note> and imperiouſly <hi>rules in the Children of diſobedience.</hi> He is therefore ſtiled <hi>the Prince and god of this World.</hi> And what more contumelious indignity can there be, than the preferring to the glorious Creator of Heaven and Earth, a damned Spirit, the moſt curſed part of the Creation? It is moſt reaſonable, that the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Competitour, ſhould be a foil to reinforce the luſtre of Gods authority: yet Men reject God and comply with the tempter. O prodigious perverſneſs!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin vilifies the ruling Wiſdom of God, that preſcrib'd the Law to Men. Altho the dominion of God over us be Supreme and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, yet 'tis exercis'd according <hi>to the councel of his Will,</hi> by the beſt means,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17</note> for the beſt ends: he is accordingly ſtiled by the Apoſtle, <hi>The eternal King, and only wiſe God.</hi> 'Tis the glorious Prerogative of his Sovereignty and Deity, that he can do no wrong: for he neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily acts according to the excellencies of his Nature. Particularly, his Wiſdom is ſo relucent in his Laws, that the ſerious contemplation of it, will raviſh the ſincere minds of Men into a compliance with them. They are framed with exact congruity to the Nature of God, and his relation to us, and to the faculties of Man before he was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. From hence the Divine Law being the tranſcript not only of Gods Will but his Wiſdom, binds the underſtanding and will, our leading faculties, to eſteem and approve, to conſent and chooſe all his precepts as beſt. Now ſin vilifies the infinite underſtanding of God with reſpect both to the precepts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>w, the rule of our duty, and the ſanction annext to confirm its oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively tax the precepts as unequal, too rigid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d ſevere a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement to our wills and actions. Thus the impious Rebels complain. <hi>The ways of the Lord are not equal,</hi> as injurious to their liberty, and not worthy of obſervance. What St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, to correct the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40119:112"/> uncharitable, cenſorious Humour of ſome in his time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>James</hi> 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>He that ſpeaks evil of his brother, and judges his brother, ſpeaks evil of the law and judges the law;</hi> as an imperfect and raſh rule, is aplicable to Sinners in any other kind. As an unskillful Hand by ſtraining too high, breaks the ſtrings of an Inſtrument, and ſpoils the Muſick, ſo the Strictneſs and Severity of the Precepts, breaks the harmonious Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wills of Men and the Law, and caſts an Imputation of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence upon the Law-giver. This is the implicit Blaſphemy in Sin.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Law has Rewards and Puniſhments to ſecure our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and Obedience to it. The wiſe God knows the Frame of the reaſonable Creature, what are the inward Springs of our Actions, and has accordingly propounded ſuch Motives to our Hope and Fear, the moſt active Paſſions, as may engage us to perform our Duty. He promiſes his <hi>favour that is better then life,</hi> to the Obedient, and threatens <hi>his wrath, that is worſe then death to the rebellious.</hi> Now Sin makes it evident, that theſe Motives are not effectual in the Minds of Men: And this reflects upon the Wiſdom of the Law-giver, as if defective in not binding his Subjects firmly to their Duty; for if the Advantage or Pleaſure that may be gain'd by Sin, be greater than the Reward that is promiſed to Obedience, and the Puniſhment that is threatned againſt the Tranſgreſſion, the Law is unable to reſtrain from Sin, and the Ends of Government are not obtained. Thus Sinners in venturing upon forbidden things, reproach the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Divine Law-giver.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sin is a Contrariety to the unſpotted Holineſs of God. Of all the glorious and benign Conſtellation of the Divine Attributes that ſhine in the Law of God, his Holineſs has the brighteſt Luſtre. God is Holy in all his Works, but the moſt venerable and precious Monument of his Holineſs is the Law. For the Holineſs of God conſiſts in the Correſpondence of his Will and Actions with his moral Perfections, Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Juſtice; and the Law is the perfect Copy of his Nature and Will. The Pſalmiſt who had a purged Eye, ſaw and admir'd its Purity and Perfection.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140.</note> 
               <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord is pure, inlightning the eyes. The word is very pure, therefore thy ſervant loves it.</hi> 'Tis the perſpicuous and glorious Rule of our Duty without Blemiſh or Imperfection. <hi>The Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is holy, juſt and good.</hi> It injoyns nothing but what is abſolutely Good, without the leaſt Tincture of Evil. The Sum of it is ſet down by the Apoſtle, to <hi>live ſoberly,</hi> that is, to abſtain from any thing that may ſtain the Excellence of an underſtanding Creature: To <hi>live righteouſly,</hi> which reſpects the State and Scituation wherein God has diſpoſed Men for his Glory: It comprehends all the reſpective Duties to others, to whom we are united by the Bands of Nature, or of civil Society, or of Spiritual Communion: <hi>And to live godly,</hi> which includes all the internal and outward Duties we owe to God, who is the Sovereign of our Spirits, whoſe Will muſt be the Rule, and his
<pb facs="tcp:40119:113"/> Glory the End of our Actions. In ſhort, The Law is ſo form'd, that preſcinding from the Authority of the Law-giver, its Holineſs and Goodneſs lays an eternal Obligation on us to obey it. Now Sin is not only by Interpretation, a Reproach to the Wiſdom and other Perfections of God, but directly and formally a Contrariety to his infinite Sanctity and Purity; for it conſiſts in a not doing what the Law commands,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> or doing what it forbids. 'Tis therefore ſaid, <hi>That the carnal mind is Enmity againſt God:</hi> An active, immediate and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable Contrariety to his holy Nature and Will: From henee there is a reciprocal Hatred between God and Sinners: <hi>God is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> without an infinite Diſplicence, the Effects of which will fall upon Sinners; and tho' 'tis an Impiety hardly conceivable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> yet the Scripture tells us, that <hi>they are haters of God.</hi> 'Tis true, God by the tranſcendent Excellence of his Nature is uncapable of ſuffering any Evil, and there are few in the preſent State, arrived to ſuch Malice, as to declare open Enmity and War againſt God. In the Damned this Hatred is explicit and direct, the Fever is hightned to a Frenzy, the bleſſed God is the Object of their Curſes and eternal Averſation: If their Rage could extend to him, and their Power were equal to their Deſires, they would Dethrone the moſt High. And the Seeds of this are in the Breaſts of Sinners here. As the fearful Expectation of irreſiſtible and fiery Vengeance increaſes, their Averſation increaſes. They endeavour to raſe out the Inſcription of God in their Souls, and to extinguiſh the thoughts and ſenſe of their Inſpector and Judge. They wiſh he were not All-ſeeing and Almighty, but Blind and Impotent, uncapable to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Honour of his deſpiſed Deity. <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God:</hi> The Heart is the Fountain of Deſires, and Actions interpret the Thoughts and Affections, from whence the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is direct and concluſive, that habitual Sinners, <hi>who live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world,</hi> have ſecret Deſires; there was no Sovereign being, to obſerve and require an account of all their Actions. The radical cauſe of this Hatred is from the Oppoſition of the ſinful polluted Wills of Men, to the Holineſs of God; for that attribute excites his Juſtice, and Power, and Wrath, to puniſh Sinners. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They are enemies to God in their minds through wicked works.</hi> The naked repreſenting of this Impiety, that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creature ſhould hate the bleſſed Creator for his moſt Divine Perfections, cannot but ſtrike with Horror. O the Sinfulneſs of Sin!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sin is the Contempt and Abuſe of his excellent Goodneſs. This Argument is as vaſt as God's innumerable Mercies, whereby he allures and obliges us to Obedience: I ſhall reſtrain my Diſcourſe of it, to three things wherein the Divine Goodneſs is very Conſpicuous, and moſt ungratefully deſpiſed by Sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:40119:113"/>1. His Creating Goodneſs. 'Tis clear without the lea ſt ſhadow of Doubt, that nothing can give the firſt being to it ſelf; for this were to be before it was, which is a direct Contradiction: and 'tis evident that God is the ſole Author of our Beings. Our Parents afforded the groſs matter of our compounded Nature, but the Variety and Union, the Beauty and Uſefulneſs of the ſeveral Parts, which is ſo Wonderful, that the Body is compoſed of as many Miracles as Members, was the Deſign of his Wiſdom, and the Work of his Hands. The lively Idea and perfect Exemplar of that regular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, was modell'd in the Divine Mind. This affected the Pſalmiſt with Admiration: <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knows right well. Thine eyes did ſee my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet being imperfect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> obſerves, <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhioned me round about.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 10.8.</note> The Soul, our principal Part, is of a celeſtial Original, inſpired from <hi>the father of Spirits.</hi> The faculties of Underſtanding and Election, are the indelible Characters of our Dignity above the Brutes, and make us capable to pleaſe, and glorifie, and enjoy him. This firſt and fundamental Benefit, upon which all other Favours and Benefits are the Superſtructure, was the Effect from an eternal Cauſe, his moſt free Decree, that ordained our Birth in the ſpaces of time. The Fountain was his pure Goodneſs; there was no neceſſity determining his Will, he did not want external declarative Glory, being infinitely happy in himſelf, and there could be no ſuperior Power to conſtrain him. And that which renders our Maker's Goodneſs more free and obliging, is the conſideration he might have created Millions of Men, and left us in our Native Nothing; and, as I may ſo ſpeak, loſt and buried in perpetual Darkneſs. Now, what was Gods end in Making us? Certainly it was becoming his infinite Underſtanding, that is, to communicate of his own Divine Fullneſs, and to be actively glorified by intelligent Creatures. Accordingly 'tis the ſolemn Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Repreſentative Church. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive glory, and honour, and power: For thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they were created.</hi> Who is ſo void of rational Sentiments,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11.</note> as not to acknowledge 'tis our indiſpenſable Duty, <hi>Our reaſonable ſervice, to offer up our ſelves, an intire living Sacrifice to his glory?</hi> What is more natural, according to the Laws of uncorrupt Natures (I might ſay, and of corrupt Nature, for the Heathens practiſed it) than that Love ſhould correſpond with Love, as the one deſcends in Benefits, the other ſhould aſcend in Thankfulneſs. As a poliſh'd Looking-glaſs of Steel, ſtrongly reverberates the Beams of the Sun ſhining upon it, without loſing a ſpark of light, thus the underſtanding Soul ſhould reflect the Affection of Love upon our bleſſed Maker, in Reverence, and Praiſe, and Thankfulneſs. Now Sin breaks all thoſe Sacred Bands of Grace and Gratitude, that engage us to love and obey God. He is the juſt Lord of all our Faculties Intellectual and Senſitive, and
<pb facs="tcp:40119:114"/> the Sinner employs them as Weapons of Unrighteouſneſs againſt him. He preſerves us by his powerful gracious Providence, which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Creation every Moment, and the Goodneſs he uſes to us, the Sinner abuſes againſt him. This is the moſt unworthy, ſhameful and monſtrous Ingratitude. This makes forgetful and unthankful Men, more brutiſh than <hi>the dull Ox, and the ſtupid Aſs,</hi> who ſerve thoſe that feed them; nay, ſinks them below the inſenſible part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that invariably obſerves the Law and order preſcribed by the Creator. Aſtoniſhing Degeneracy! <hi>Hear O Heavens, give ear, O earth, I have nouriſhed and brought up Childen, and they have rebelled againſt me,</hi> was the Complaint of God himſelf. The conſiderate Review of this, will melt us into Tears of Confuſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Twas the unvaluable goodneſs of God to give his Law to Man, for his rule, both in reſpect of the matter of the Law, and his end in giving it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The matter of the Law, this as is forecited from the Apoſtle, <hi>is holy, juſt, and good. It contains all things that are honeſt, and juſt, and pure, and lovely, and of good report, whatſoever are vertuous and praiſe-worthy.</hi> In obedience to it the innocence and perfection of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature conſiſts. This I do but glance upon, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The end of giving the Law. God was pleas'd upon Mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by an illuſtrious revelation to ſhew him his duty, to <hi>write his Law in his Heart,</hi> that he might not take one ſtep out of the circle of its precepts, and immediately ſin and periſh. His gracious deſign was to keep Man in his love; that from the obedience of the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the divine goodneſs might take its riſe to reward him. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feined and excellent goodneſs, the ſinner outragiouſly deſpiſes: for what greater contempt can be expreſt againſt a written Law, than the tearing it in pieces, and trampling it underfoot? And this conſtructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſinner does to the Law of God, which contempt extends to the gracious giver of it.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Sin is an extreme vilifying of Gods goodneſs, in preferring car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures to his favour, and Communion with him, wherein the life, the felicity, the heaven of the reaſonable creature conſiſts. God is infinite in all poſſible perfections, all-ſufficient to make us compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eternally happy: he diſdains to have any competitour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be ſupreme in our eſteem and affections: the reaſon of this is ſo evident by Divine and Natural light, that 'tis needleſs to ſpend many words about it. 'Tis an obſervation of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Omnes Deos colendos eſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pienti.

Evang. c. 17.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>That it was a rule amongſt the Heathens, that a wiſe man ſhould worſhip all their Deities.</hi> The Romans were ſo inſatiable in Idolatry, that they ſent to forreign Countries to bring the gods of ſeveral Nations: an unpoliſht Stone, a tame Serpent, that were reputed Deities, they received with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and reverence. But the true God had no Temple, no Worſhip in <hi>Rome,</hi> where there was a <hi>Pantheon</hi> dedicated to the honour of all the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40119:114"/> falſe gods. The reaſon he gives of it is, that the true God who alone has Divine Excellencies, and Divine Empire, will be worſhipt alone, and ſtrictly forbids the aſſumption of any into his Throne. To adore any beſides him is infinitely debaſing, and provoking to his dread Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Now ſin in its nature is a converſion from God to the creature; and whatever the temptation be, in yielding to it, there is ſignified, that we chooſe ſomething before his favour. Sin is founded <hi>in bono jucundo,</hi> ſomething that is delectable to the carnal Nature: 'tis the univerſal character of carnal Men, <hi>they are lovers of pleaſure more than lovers of God.</hi> To ſome riches are the moſt alluring object. The young Man in the Goſpel, when our Saviour commanded <hi>him to give his eſtate to the poor, and he ſhould have treaſure in Heaven, went away ſorrowful,</hi> as if he had been offer'd to his loſs. To others the pleaſures that in ſtrict propriety are ſenſual, are moſt charming. Love is the weight of the Soul that turns it, not like a dead weight of the Scales, but with election freely to its object: in the carnal ballance the preſent things of the World are of conſpicuous moment, and outweigh Spiritual and Eternal bleſſings. Altho the favour of God be eminently all that can be deſir'd, under the notion of riches, or honour, or pleaſure, and every atom of our affection is due to him; yet carnal Men think it a cheap purchaſe to obtain the good things of this World, by ſinful means, with the loſs of his favour. This their actions declare. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious folly! as if a few ſparks ſtruck out of a Flint, that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afford light or warmth, were more deſirable than the Sun in its brightneſs. And how contumelious and provoking it is to God, he declares in the moſt moving expreſſions; <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13.</note>

For my people have committed two evils; they have forſaken me the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hewed them out broken ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately was charg'd upon the Jews, who ſet up Idols of jealouſie, and ador'd them, rather than the glorious <hi>Jehovah:</hi> and in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis true of all ſinners; for every vicious affection prefers ſome vain object, before his Love, and the enjoyment of his glorious preſence, that is the reward of obedience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſinner diſparages the impartial Juſtice of God. In the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law there is a connexion between ſin and puniſhment; the evil of doing and the evil of ſuffering. This is not a mere arbitrary conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but founded on the inſeparable deſert of ſin, and the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Gods nature, which unchangably loves holineſs, and hates ſin. Altho the threatning does not lay a ſtrict neceſſity upon the Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver always to inflict the puniſhment; yet God having declar'd his equal Laws as the rule of our duty, and of his judgment, if they ſhould be uſually without effect upon offenders, the bands of Government would be diſſolved, and conſequently the honour of his juſtice ſtain'd both with reſpect to his nature and office: for as an eſſential attribute 'tis the correſpondence of his will and actions with his moral perfections, and as Sovereign Ruler, he is to preſerve equity and order in his Kingdom.
<pb facs="tcp:40119:115"/> Now thoſe who voluntarily break his Law, preſume upon impunity. The firſt rebellious ſin was committed upon this preſumption: God threaten'd, <hi>if you eat the forbidden fruit you ſhall die: the Serpent ſays eat, and you ſhall not die,</hi> and aſſenting to the temptation <hi>Adam</hi> fell to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.

The ſinner commits the Divine Attributes to fight againſt one another, preſuming that Mercy will diſarm Juſtice and ſtop its terrible effects upon impenitent obſtinate ſinners: From hence they become bold and hardnen'd in the continuance of their ſins.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſinner implicitly denies Gods omniſcience. There is ſuch a turpitude adhering to ſin, that it cannot endure the light of the Sun, or the light of Conſcience, but ſeeks to be conceal'd under a mask of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or a vail of darkneſs. There are very few on this ſide Hell, ſo trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into the likeneſs of the Devil, as to be impenetrable by ſhame. What is ſaid of the Adulterer and Theif, ſinners of greater guilt, and deeper dye,<note place="margin">Job.</note> is true in proportion of every ſinner: <hi>If a Man ſees them, they are in the terrors of the ſhadow of death.</hi> Now from whence is it that many who if they were ſurpriz'd in the actings of their ſins, by a Child or a ſtranger, would bluſh and tremble, yet altho the holy God ſees all their ſins in order to judge them, and will judge in order to puniſh them, are ſecure without any fearful or ſhameful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his preſence? Did they ſtedfaſtly believe that their foul vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies were open to his piercing, pure and ſevere Eye, they muſt be ſtruck with terrors, and cover'd with Confuſion. <hi>Will he force the Queen before my face,</hi> was the ſpeech of the King inflamed with wrath, and the prologue of Death againſt the fallen favourite. Would Men dare to affront Gods authority, and outragiouſly break his Laws before his face, if they duly conſider'd his omnipreſence and obſervance of them? it were impoſſible. And infidelity is the radical cauſe of their inconſideration. It was a falſe imputation againſt <hi>Job,</hi> but juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wicked,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Thou ſayeſt, How does God know, can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he ſees not. And ſuch are introduced by the Pſalmiſt declaring their inward ſentiments; The Lord ſhall not ſee, neither ſhall the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, The ſinner ſlights the power of God. This attribute renders God a dreadful Judge. He has a right to puniſh, and power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40119:115"/> every tranſgreſſion of his Law. His judicial power is ſupreme, his executive is irreſiſtible. He can with one ſtroke diſpatch the Body to the Grave, and the Soul to Hell, and make Men as miſerable as they are ſinful. Yet ſinners as boldly provoke him, as if there were no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. We read of the infatuated <hi>Syrians,</hi> that they thought that God the Protector of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had only <hi>power on the Hills,</hi> and not <hi>in the Vallies,</hi> and renewed the War to their deſtruction. Thus ſinners enter into the liſts with God, and range an Army of luſts againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Heaven, and blindly bold run upon their own deſtruction. They neither believe his all-ſeeing Eye, nor all-mighty Hand. They change the glory of the living God into a dead Idol, that has Eyes and ſees not, and Hands and handles not, and accordingly his threatnings make no impreſſion upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus I have preſented a true view of the evil of ſin conſider'd in it ſelf: but as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of God, <hi>how little a portion of him is known?</hi> May be ſaid of the evil of ſin, how little of it is known? For in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as our apprehenſions are defective and below the greatneſs of God, ſo are they of the evil of ſin that contradicts his Sovereign will and diſhonours his excellent perfections.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin relatively to us, is the moſt pernicious and deſtructive Evil. If we compare it with temporal Evils, it preponderates all that Men are liable to in the preſent World. Diſeaſes in our Bodies, diſaſters in our Eſtates, diſgrace in our Reputation, are in juſt eſteem far leſs evil than the evil of ſin: for that corrupts and deſtroys our more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and immortal part: The <hi>vile Body</hi> is of no account in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>the precious Soul.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle enforces his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Dearly beloved brethren, abſtain from fleſhly luſts, that war againſt the Soul.</hi> The iſſue of this War is infinitely more woful, than of the moſt cruel againſt our Bodies and Goods, our Liberties and Lives: for our Eſtates and Freedom if loſt may be recover'd; if the preſent Life be loſt for the cauſe of God, it ſhall be reſtor'd in greater luſtre and perfection; but if the Soul be loſt, 'tis loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>All temporal Evils are conſiſtent with the love of God: <hi>Job</hi> on the dunghil, roughcaſt with Ulcers, was moſt precious in Gods ſight: <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> in the loweſt poverty, and waſted with loathſom Sores, was dear to his affections; a guard of Angels was ſent to convey his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Soul to the Divine Preſence. <hi>But ſin ſeparates between God and us,</hi> who is the fountain of felicity, and the center of reſt to the Soul.</p>
            <p>Other evils God who is our wiſe and compaſſionate Father and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, makes uſe of, as Medicinal preparations for the cure of ſin: and certainly the Diſeaſe which would be the death of the Soul, is worſe than the Remedy, tho' never ſo bitter and afflicting to ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Sin is an evil of that malignity, that the leaſt degree of it is fatal. If it be conceiv'd in the Soul, tho' not actually finiſht, 'tis deadly. One ſin corrupted in an inſtant angelical excellencies, and turn'd the glorious Spirits of Heaven into Devils. 'Tis a poiſon ſo ſtrong, that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:116"/> the firſt taſte of it ſhed a deadly taint and malignity into the veins of all mankind.</p>
            <p>Sin is ſuch an exceeding Evil, that 'tis the ſevereſt puniſhment Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice inflicts on ſinners on this ſide Hell. The giving <hi>Men over to the power of their luſts,</hi> is the moſt fearful judgment, not only with reſpect to the cauſe, Gods unrelenting and unquenchable anger, and the iſſue, everlaſting deſtruction, but in the quality of the judgment. Nay, did ſin appear as odious in our Eyes as it does in Gods, we ſhould account it the worſt part of Hell it ſelf, the pollutions of the damned to be an evil exceeding the torments ſuperadded to them.</p>
            <p>Sin is pregnant with all kinds of Evils, the ſeeds of it are big with Judgments. The evils that are obvious to ſenſe, or that are Spiritual and Inward, Temporal and Eternal Evils, all proceed from ſin, often as the Natural cauſe, and always as the Meritorious. And many times the ſame puniſhment is produc'd by the efficiency of ſin, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for its guilt. Thus uncleanneſs without the miraculous waters of Jealouſie rots the Body, and the pleaſure of ſin is revenged by a loathſom conſuming Diſeaſe, the natural conſequence of it. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and luxury, ſhorten the lives of Men and accelerate dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Fierce deſires, and wild rage are fewel for the everlaſting fire in Hell. The ſame evils conſidered Phyſically are from the efficiency of ſin, conſider'd legally are from the guilt of ſin, and the juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>This being a point of great uſefulneſs, that I may be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, I will conſider the evils that are conſequential to ſin under theſe two Heads. 1. Such as proceed immediately from it by Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. Thoſe evils, and all other as the effects of Gods juſtice and ſentence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The evils that proceed immediately by emanation from it: and tho' ſome of them are not reſented with feeling apprehenſions by ſinners, yet they are of a fearful nature. Sin has deprived Man of the purity, nobility, and peace of his innocent ſtate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It has ſtain'd and tainted him, with an univerſal, intimate, and permanent pollution. Man in his firſt Creation was holy and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: a beam of beauty derived from Heaven was ſhed upon his Soul, in compariſon of which ſenſitive beauty is but as the clearneſs of Glaſs, to the luſtre of a Diamond. His underſtanding <hi>was light in the Lord,</hi> his will and affections were regular and pure, the Divine Image was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon all his faculties, that attracted the love and complacency of God himſelf. Sin has blotted out all his aimiable excellencies, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduc'd the moſt foul deformity, the original of which was fetcht from Hell. Sinners are the natural Children of Satan, of a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to him. The Scripture borrows compariſons to repreſent the defiling quality of ſin, from pollutions that are moſt loathſom to our ſenſes: <hi>from peſtilential <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers, putrifying Sores, filthy Vomit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing Mire.</hi> This pollution is univerſal through the whole Man, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Soul and Body.</hi> It darkens the mind, our ſupreme faculty, with a cloud of Corruption: it depraves the will, and vitiates the affections.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40119:116"/>
'Tis a pollution ſo deep and permanent, that the Deluge that ſwept away a World of ſinners did not waſh away their ſins: and the fire at the laſt day, that ſhall devour the droſs of the viſible World, and renew the Heavens and the Earth, ſhall not purge away the ſins of the guilty Inhabitants. This pollution hath ſo defil'd and disfigur'd Man, who was a fair and lovely type, wherein the skill and perfections of the Creator was conſpicuous, <hi>that it repented God, that he made Man.</hi> As an Artificer having form'd a ſurprizing piece, either a Statue or Picture, wherein Art almoſt equall'd the life and luſtre of Nature; if it be torn or broken, throws it from his ſight with ſorrow, impatient to ſee it ſo rudely defaced: thus God is ſaid <hi>to hide his face from ſinners,</hi> to expreſs his diſpleaſure, as unwilling to behold the Diſparagement of his Maſter-piece, the excellent Product of his Wiſdom and Power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin has degraded Man from his native State and Dignity. Man by his Extraction and Deſcent was <hi>the Son of God, a little lower than the Angels,</hi> conſecrated and crowned, as a Prieſt for the Service and Communion with his glorious Maker, and as King over the World. <hi>But being in honour, he underſtood not his dignity, his duty and felicity, and became like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> By his Rebellion againſt his Creator, he made a Forfeitute of his Dominion, and loſt the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of ſenſible Creatures, and the Service of Inſenſible; which I only mention, and ſhall reſtrain my Conſideration, to ſhew how he is become like the Beaſts, as an Effect reſulting from his Sin. He is deveſted of his White Robe of Innocence, and his nobleſt Perfections, Reaſon and Religion. Senſe and Imagination, the leading Faculties in Brutes, are his Rulers: The rational governing Powers of Man, have loſt their ſuperior Sway, and the Carnal Paſſions rove with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reins to forbidden Objects. The lower Appetites are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, which is the moſt ignominious and cruel Servitude wherein humane Liberty can be intangled and fetter'd. His Underſtanding and Will, that were capable of taking a flight for the Diſcovery and Fruition of celeſtial and eternal things are debaſed, and limited to ſenſual periſhing things, and derive vilifying Qualities from them. <hi>He is earthly minded,</hi> his Aims, Contrivances, Deſires are faſtened to the Earth: the divine Spark within him is cover'd under Aſhes. <hi>He is carnally minded,</hi> always ſtudying and making <hi>proviſions for the fleſh:</hi> This is a viler Debaſement, than if the Counſellors of State were employed in the ſordid Offices of the Kitchin or Stable. Nay, 'tis a Diminution below the Rank of Beaſts, for by nature they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of directing their Eyes and Deſires towards Heaven; but Man is Brutiſh by his voluntary Sin. To ſee the Head of a rapacious Wolf, or fierce Tyger, or luſtful Horſe joyned to the Body of a Man, how monſtrous would it appear? But 'tis more unnatural and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, for Men, in whom Reaſon and Religion ſhould govern, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them in the brutiſh Appetites of Luſt and Rage; for there is a nearer Affinity between the Body of a Man and of a Beaſt, that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:117"/> agree in the common ſenſible Nature, than between the Immortal Spirit of a Man, and the Beaſts that periſh. In ſhort, Sin has enſlaved Men to Satan an Infernal Fiend: <hi>They are taken Captives by him at his pleaſure:</hi> And which is the loweſt <hi>Degradation, they are the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Sin has broke the ſweet Peace and bleſſed Concord in the Soul, the Felicity of our innocent State. Peace is the Tranquility that reſults from Order and Unity. In Man there was a regular Harmony of all his Faculties; the Affections were Conſonant with his Will, his Will with his Underſtanding, and his Underſtanding with the Law of God. This was the inward State of his Soul in his Creation; for having a derived being, it was natural and neceſſary, that he ſhould be appointed to his End, and receive his Rule for the obtaining it, from the Underſtanding and Will of his Maker. Now whilſt there was a Correſpondence in his Faculties, and their Operations with his Rule and End, the Will of God, and the Glory of God, the Reſult of it, as well as the Reward of it, was Spiritual Peace with God, Internal Peace with himſelf, External Peace with others. Now Sin has diſſolved this Unity, violated this ſacred Order: And from hence,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Peace with God, that conſiſted in his Favour and Friendſhip to us, and our filial dependence upon him, which is the Spring of full and ſatisfying Joy, is broke. God appears a fearful Enemy againſt the Sinners; the penal Effects of his Wrath, I ſhall ſpeak of diſtinctly under the ſecond general: And that Divine Calm in the Conſcience, that Peace joyn'd with the pureſt Pleaſure, that was the refleex of Gods Favour on the Soul, is changed into anxious Apprehenſions of his juſt Power to puniſh us. Guilt generates Fear, and Fear Hatred, and both cauſe a woful flight from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Internal Peace is broke by Sin. Whilſt the Paſſions were ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the Empire of Reaſon, and in accord among themſelves, there was perfect Peace; but Sin has raiſed an inteſtine War in Man's Breaſt. <hi>The Law of the Members rebels againſt the Law of the Mind:</hi> for there is no Man ſo prodigiouſly Wicked, and ſpoil'd of his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Endowments, but ſtill there remains ſome Principles of Morality in the Mind,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

But the tumultuous and tyrannical Paſſions have engaged them in mortal Enmity. 'Tis the account St. <hi>James</hi> gives, <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your Luſts, that war in your Members?</hi> Sin kindles and blows the fire of diſcord, in Families, Cities, Kingdoms: Sin is the fury that brings a ſmoking fireband from Hell, and ſets the World into combuſtion. Ambition, Avarice, the greedy deſires of Rule and Revenge, have made the World a Stage of not feigned, but the moſt bloody Tragedies. In this Men are not like, but worſe than the Beaſts: for the fierceſt Beaſts of <hi>Africa</hi> or <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> have a reſpect for their own likeneſs: tho' they devour others, yet they ſpare thoſe of their own kind: but Men are ſo degenerate as to be moſt cruel againſt their Brethren. Theſe are ſome of the Evils, that proceed from ſin as their natural Cauſe. And from hence 'tis evident, that ſin makes Men miſerable, were there no Hell of torment to receive them in the next State.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

From what height of glory and felicity into bottomleſs perdition? How are they continually rackt and tormented with the remembrance of their loſt happineſs?

            <p>One ſin of pride or envy, brought this terrible vengeance; from whence we may infer, how provoking ſin is to the holy God. We read of King <hi>

But when Man by his voluntary ſin was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the <hi>fountain of life,</hi> the Soul loſt its derivative life from God, and the active life infuſed by its union into the Body. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preſerve the natural life beyond its limited term. A righteous retaliation. Thus the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Sin came into the World, and death by ſin.</hi> Even infants who never committed ſin, die having been conceived in ſin. And death brought in its retinue evils ſo numerous and various, that their kinds are more than words to name and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them. <hi>Man that is born of a Woman is of few days, and full of trouble:</hi> at his birth he enters into a labyrinth of Thorns, this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable World, and his life is a continual turning in it: he cannot eſcape being ſometimes prick'd and torn, and at going out of it, his Soul is rent from the embraces of the Body. 'Tis as poſſible to tell the number of the waves in a tempeſtuous Sea, as to recount all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting paſſions of the Soul, all the Diſeaſes of the Body, which far exceed in number all the unhappy parts wherein they are ſeated. What an afflicting object would it be, to hear all the mournful lamentations, all the piercing complaints, all the deep groans from the miſerable in this preſent ſtate? What a proſpect of Terror, to ſee Death in its various ſhapes, by Famine, by Fire, by Sword, and by waſting or painful Diſeaſes, triumphant over all mankind? What a ſight of woe, to have all the Graves and Charnel-houſes open'd, and ſo many loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Carcaſſes, or heaps of dry naked Bones, the trophies of Death expos'd to view? Such are the afflicting and deſtructive effects of ſin. <hi>For wickedneſs burns as a fire: it devours the Briars and Thorns.</hi>

            <p>Beſides other miſeries in this life, ſometimes the terrors of an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Conſcience ſeiſe upon Men, which of all evils are moſt heavy and overwhelming. <hi>Solomon</hi> who underſtood the frame of humane Nature, tells us, <hi>The Spirit of a Man can bear his infirmity:</hi> that is, the mind fortified by Principles of moral Counſel and Conſtancy, can endure the aſſault of external Evils: <hi>but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> This is moſt inſupportable when the ſting and remorſe of the mind is from the ſenſe of guilt: for then God appears an enemy righteous and ſevere: and who can encounter with offended Omnipotence? Such is the ſharpneſs of his Sword, and the weight of his Hand, that every ſtroke is deadly inward. Satan the cruel enemy of Souls, exaſperates the wound. He diſcovers and charges ſin upon the Conſcience, with all its killing aggravations, and conceals the Divine mercy, the only
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40119:118"/> lenitive and healing Balm to the wounded Spirit. What viſions of horror, what ſpectacles of fear, what ſcenes of ſorrow are preſented to the diſtracted mind by the Prince of darkneſs? And which heigthens the miſery, Man is a worſe enemy to himſelf than Satan: he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Sword, and deſtroys himſelf. Whatever he ſees or hears, afflicts him, whatever he thinks torments him. The guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>turns the Sun into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood:</hi> the precious promiſes of the Goſpel, that aſſure favour and pardon to returning and relenting ſinners, are turn'd into arguments of deſpair, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the abuſe and provocation of mercy, and that the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in Gods boſom is become the accuſer. Doleful ſtate! Beyond the conception of all, but thoſe who are plung'd into it. How often do they run to the grave for ſanctuary, and ſeek for death as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance?</p>
            <p>Yet all theſe anxieties and terrors are but the beginning of ſorrows: for the full and terrible recompenſes of ſin ſhall follow the Eternal Judgment, pronounc'd againſt the wicked at the laſt day. 'Tis true the ſentence of the Law is paſt againſt the ſinner in this preſent ſtate, and temporal evils are the effects of it, but that ſentence is revocable: at death the ſentence is ratified by the Judge upon every impenitent ſinner; 'tis decicive of his ſtate, and involves him under puniſhment for ever: But the full execution of judgment ſhall not be till the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick general ſentence pronounc'd by the everlaſting Judge, before the whole World. It exceeds the compaſs of created thoughts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand fully the direful effects of ſin in the Eternal State: <hi>For who knows the power of Gods wrath?</hi> The Scripture repreſents the puniſhment in expreſſions, that may inſtruct the mind, and terrifie the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that may work upon the Principles of Reaſon and Senſe by which Men are naturally and ſtrongly moved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinners ſhall be excluded from Communion with the bleſſed God in Heaven, <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> In the clear and transforming viſion of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the intimate and indiſſolvable union with him by love conſiſts the perfection and ſatisfaction of the immortal Soul. The felicity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from it, is ſo entire and eternal, as God is great and true, who has ſo often promis'd it to his Saints. Now ſin ſeparates loſt Souls forever from the reviving preſence of God. Who can declare the extent and degrees of that evil? For an evil riſes in proportion to the good of which it deprives us: it muſt therefore follow, that Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bleſſedneſs being tranſcendent, the excluſion from it is proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evil: and as the felicity of the Saints reſults both from the direct poſſeſſion of Heaven, and from compariſon with the contrary ſtate: ſo the miſery of the damned ariſes, both from the thoughts of loſt happineſs, and from the laſting pain that torments them.</p>
            <p>But it may be replied, if this be the utmoſt evil that is conſequent to ſin, the threatning of it is not likely to deter but few from pleaſing their corrupt appetites: for carnal Men have ſuch groſs apprehenſions,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:119"/> and vitated affections, that they are careleſs of Spiritual glory and joy. <hi>They cannot taſte and ſee how good the Lord is:</hi> nay, the Divine Preſence would be a torment to them: for as light is the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant quality in the World to the ſound Eye, ſo 'tis very afflicting and painful to the Eye when corrupted by a ſuffuſion of humors.</p>
            <p>To this a clear anſwer may be given: in the next ſtate where the wicked ſhall for ever be without thoſe ſenſual objects which here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and delight them, their apprehenſions will be changed; they ſhall underſtand what a happineſs the fruition of the bleſſed God is, and what a miſery to be uncapable of enjoying him, and expell'd from the Celeſtial Paradiſe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 15.28.</note> Our Saviour tells the infidel Jews, <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves ſhut out.</hi> How will they pine with envy at the ſight of that trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant felicity of which they ſhall never be partakers? <hi>Depart from me,</hi> will be as terrible a part of the judgment, <hi>as eternal Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods juſtice is not ſatisfied in depriving them of Heaven, but inflicts the moſt heavy puniſhment upon Senſe and Conſcience in the damned: for as the Soul and Body in their ſtate of union in this life, were both guilty, the one as the guide, the other as the inſtrument of ſin, ſo 'tis equal when reunited they ſhould feel the penal effects of it. The Scripture repreſents both to our capacity, <hi>by the worm that never dies, and the fire that never ſhall be quenched:</hi> and <hi>by the deſtroying of Body and Soul in Hell fire.</hi> Sinners ſhall then be tormented, wherein they were moſt delighted: they ſhall be inveſted with thoſe objects, that will cauſe the moſt dolorous perceptions in their ſenſitive faculties. <hi>The lake of Fire and Brimſtone, the blackneſs of darkneſs,</hi> are words of a terrible ſignification, and intended to awaken ſinners to fly <hi>from the wrath to come.</hi> But no words can fully reveal the terrible ingredients of their miſery: the puniſhment will be in proportion to the glory of Gods Majeſty that is diſhonour'd and provok'd by ſin, and the extent of his power. And as the Soul was the principal, and the Body but an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the works of ſin, ſo its capacious faculties will be far more tormented, than the more limited faculties of the outward ſenſes. The fiery Attributes of God ſhall be tranſmitted through the glaſs of Conſcience, and concenter'd upon damned Spirits: the fire without them is not ſo tormenting as this fire within them. How will the tormenting paſſions be inflam'd? What rancour, reluctance, and rage againſt the power above that ſentenc'd them to Hell? What impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and indignation againſt themſelves for their wilful ſins the juſt cauſe of it? How will they curſe their Creation, and wiſh their utter extinction as the final remedy of their miſery? But all their ardent wiſhes are in vain: for the guilt of ſin will never be expiated, nor God ſo far reconcil'd as to annihilate them. As long as there is juſtice
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40119:119"/> in Heaven, and fire in Hell, as long as God and Eternity ſhall continue, they muſt ſuffer theſe torments, which the ſtrength and patience of an Angel cannot bear one hour. From hence we may infer, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable evil there is in ſin, and how hateful it is to the moſt High, when God <hi>who is love,</hi> who is <hi>ſtiled the Father of mercies,</hi> has prepared and does inflict ſuch Plagues for ever for the tranſgreſſion of his holy Laws: and ſuch is the equity of his judgment, that he never puni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es offenders above their deſert.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now apply this Doctrin, by reflecting the light of it upon our minds and hearts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This diſcovers how perverſe and depraved the minds and wills of Men are, <hi>to chuſe ſin rather than affliction,</hi> and break the Divine Law for the obtaining temporal things. If one with an attentive Eye regards the generality of mankind, what dominion preſent and ſenſible things have over them, how ſecurely and habitually they ſin in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their carnal aims, as if the Soul ſhould not ſurvive the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as if there were no Tribunal above to examine, no Judge to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and puniſh ſinners, if he has not marble bowels, it will excite his compaſſion or indignation. What compariſon is there between the good things of this World, and of the next in degrees or durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Aiery honour, Senſual pleaſures, and Worldly riches, are but the thin appearances of happineſs, ſhadows in maſquerade, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford ſolid content to an immortal Spirit: the bleſſedneſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven repleniſhes with everlaſting ſatisfaction. What proportion is there between the <hi>light and momentary afflictions here,</hi> and a vaſt eternity <hi>fill'd with indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſorrow?</hi> What ſtupid Beaſt, what monſter of a Man, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſuperficial tranſient delight, the pleaſure of a ſhort dream, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever-ſatisfying joys? Or to avoid a ſlight evil venture upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? Yet this is the true caſe of ſinners: if they can obtain the World with the loſs of Heaven, they count it a valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, if they can compound ſo, as to eſcape temporal troubles, tho involved under guilt that brings extream and eternal miſery, they think it a ſaving bargain. Amazing ſolly! Either they believe or do not, the recompenſes in the future ſtate: if they do not, how unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is their impiety? If they do, 'tis more prodigious they do not <hi>feel the powers of the World to come</hi> ſo as to regulate their lives and controule the ſtrongeſt temptations to ſin againſt God. A wicked believer is more guilty than a wicked infidel. How could we conceive it poſſible, were it not viſible in their actions, that Men who have judicative faculties to compare and diſtinguiſh things, and accordingly be moved with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or fears, ſhould with ardent affections purſue deſpicable vanities, and neglect ſubſtantial happineſs, and be fearful of the ſhadows of dangers, and intrepid in the midſt of the trueſt dangers! He is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate gameſter that will venture a Crown at a throw, againſt ſome petty advantage: yet this is really done by ſinners who hazard the loſs
<pb facs="tcp:40119:120"/> of Heaven for this World: they hang by ſlender ſtrings, a little breath that expires every moment, over bottomleſs perdition, and are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without any palpitation of Heart, any ſign of fear.</p>
            <p>How ſtrong is the deluſion and concupiſcence of the carnally mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The luſts of the fleſh bribe and corrupt their underſtandings, or diverts them from ſerious conſideration of their ways and the iſſues of them. From hence it is they are preſently entangled and vanquiſht by ſenſual temptations; they are cozened by the colours of good and evil, and Satan eaſily accompliſhes his moſt pernicious and envious deſign, to make Men miſerable as himſelf. How juſt is the reproach of Wiſdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity, and fools hate knowledge?</hi> The light of reaſon and revelation ſhines upon them, they have not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of ignorance, but the righteous and heavy <hi>condemnation of thoſe who love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> 'Tis no mean degree of guilt to extenuate ſin, and make an apology for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The wiſeſt of Men, tells us, <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin:</hi> they count it a fond niceneſs, a ſilly preciſeneſs to be fearful of offending God. They boaſt of their deceitful arts and inſinuations, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent ſin as a light matter, to corrupt others. But 'tis infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be defective in the ſubtilty of the Serpent, than in the innocence of the Dove. A meer natural, who is only capable of ſenſitive acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is diſtinguiſht from a Brute by his ſhape, is not ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſot, as the ſinful fool. What the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks of one who gets riches unjuſtly, that he ſhall leave them, and <hi>in the end die a fool,</hi> will be verified of the wilful obſtinate ſinner: in the end he ſhall by the terrible conviction of his own mind be found guilty of the moſt woful folly: and how many have acknowledged in their laſt hours, when uſually Men ſpeak with the moſt feeling and leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, how have they in words of the Pſalmiſt arraigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>So fooliſh have we been, and like beaſts before thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence we may be inſtructed of the wonderful patience of God, who bears with a World of ſinners, that are obnoxious to his juſtice, and under his power every day. If we conſider the number and aggravations of Mens ſins, how many have out-told the hairs of their Heads in actual tranſgreſſions, how mighty and manifeſt their ſins are, that the Deity and Providence are queſtioned for the ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vengeance, and yet that God notwithſtanding all their enormous injuries, and violent provocations is patient towards ſinners, it cannot but fill us with admiration. His Mercy like the cheerful light of the Sun viſits us every Morning, with its benign influences; his Juſtice, like Thunder, rarely ſtrikes the Wicked. He affords not only the ſupports of life, but many comforts and refreſhments to the unthankful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious.</p>
            <p>'Tis not from any defect in his Power that they are not conſum'd, but from the abundance of his Mercy. He made the World without any ſtrain of his Power, and can as eaſily deſtroy it: he has an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels attending his Commands, and every An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

               </gap> crying ſins, and his long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance expects their repentance. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack, as ſome Men count ſlackneſs, but he is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> He ſpares ſinners with ſuch indulgence, in order to their Salvation. 'Tis deſervedly one of his Royal Titles, <hi>the God of Patience.</hi> Our fierce Spirits are apt to take fire and revenge for every injury real, or ſuppos'd; but the great God, who is infinitely ſenſible of all the indignities offer'd to his Majeſty, <hi>defers his anger, and loads them with his benefits every day.</hi> What is more aſtoniſhing than <hi>the riches of his Goodneſs,</hi> unleſs it be the perverſe abuſe of it by ſinners to harden themſelves in their impieties? But altho his Clemency delays the puniſhment, the ſacredneſs and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Juſtice will not forget it: <hi>when patience has had its perfect work,</hi> Juſtice ſhall have a ſolemn triumph in the final deſtruction of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unreformed ſinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conſideration of the Evil of Sin, ſo great in it ſelf, and pernicious to us, hightens our Obligations to the Divine Mercy, in ſaving <hi>us from our ſins,</hi> and an everlaſting Hell the juſt Puniſhment of them. Our Loſs was unvaluable, our Miſery extream, and without infinite Mercy, we had been under an unremediable neceſſity of Sinning and Suffering for ever. God ſaw us in this wretched and deſperate State, <hi>and his eye affected his heart, in his pity he redeemed</hi> and reſtored us. This is the cleareſt Teſtimony of pure Goodneſs: for God did not want external Glory, who is infinitely Happy in his own Perfections: he could, when Man revolted from his Duty, have created a new World of Innocent Creatures: for infinite Power is not ſpent nor leſſened by finite Productions, but his undeſerved and undeſired Mercy appeared in our Salvation.

            </p>
            <p>And how dear are our Engagements to Jeſus Chriſt? The Judge would not releaſe the Guilty without a Ranſom, nor the Surety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Satisfaction, and the Son of God moſt compaſſionately and willingly gave his precious Blood to obtain our Deliverance. If his Perfections were not moſt aimable and raviſhing, yet that he died for us, ſhould infinitely endear him to us. <hi>To thoſe who believe he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:</hi> to thoſe who have felt their undone Condition, and that by his Merits and Mediation, are reſtored to the Favour of God, he is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb facs="tcp:40119:121"/> precious. Who can break <hi>the Conſtraints of ſuch Love?</hi> If there be a ſpark of reaſon, or a grain of unfeigned Faith in us, <hi>We muſt judge, that if one died for all, then all were dead, and thoſe that live, ſhould live to his Glory who died for their Salvation.</hi>

He was the eternal Son of God, the Heir of his Fathers Love and Glory, the Lord of Angels; he ſuffered in his Body the moſt ignominious and painful Death, being nail'd to the Croſs in the ſight of the World: The Sufferings of his Soul were incomparably more afflicting: For though heavenly Meek he indured the Deriſion and cruel Violence of his Enemies with a ſilent Patience, yet in the dark Eclipſe of his Fathers Countenance, in the deſolate ſtate of his Soul, <hi>the Lamb of God opened his Mouth</hi> in that mournful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> His innocent Nature did ſo recoil from thoſe fearful Sufferings, that with repeated ardency of Affection, he deprecated that bitter Cup: <hi>Abba Father, all things are poſſible to thee, let this cup paſs from me:</hi> He addreſs'd to the Divine Power and Love, the Attributes that relieve the Miſerable, yet he drank off the dregs of the Cup of Gods Wrath. Now we may from hence conclude, how great an Evil Sin is, that could not be expiated by a meaner Sacrifice, <hi>then the offering up the Soul of Chriſt</hi> to atone incenſed Juſtice; and no lower a Price, than the Blood of the Son of God, the moſt unvaluable Treaſure could Ranſom Men who were devoted to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The conſideration of the evil of ſin in it ſelf and to us, ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us with a holy circumſpection to keep our ſelves from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with it. 'Tis our indiſpenſable duty, our tranſcendent intereſt to obey the Divine Law entirely and conſtantly. The tempter cannot preſent any motives, that to a rectified mind are ſufficient to induce a conſent to ſin and offend God. Let the ſcales be even, and put into one all the delights of the ſenſes, all the pleaſures and honours of the World, which are the Elements of carnal felicity, how light are they againſt the enjoyment of the bleſſed God in glory? Will the gain of this periſhing World, compenſate the loſs of the Soul and Salvation for ever? If there were any poſſible compariſon between empty delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vanities, and celeſtial happineſs, the choice would be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and the miſtake leſs culpable, but they vaniſh into nothing in the compariſon; ſo that to commit the leaſt ſin that makes us liable to the forfeiture of Heaven, for <hi>the pleaſures of ſin that are but for a ſeaſon,</hi> is madneſs in that degree that no words can expreſs. Suppoſe the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſpires his Rage into his Slaves, and tries to conſtrain us to Sin by Perſecution; how unreaſonable is it to be diſmayed at the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Men, <hi>who muſt dye,</hi> and who can only touch the Body, and to <hi>deſpiſe the terrors of the Lord,</hi> who lives for ever and can puniſh for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:40119:121"/> ever? Methinks we ſhould look upon the perverted raging World, as a ſwarm of angry Flies, that may diſquiet, but cannot hurt us. <hi>Socrates,</hi> when unrighteouſly proſecuted to Death, ſaid of his Enemies, with a Courage becoming the Breaſt of a Chriſtian, <hi>They may Kill me, but cannot Hurt me.</hi> How ſhould theſe Conſiderations raiſe in us an invincible Reſolution and Reluctancy againſt the Tempter, in all his Approaches and Addreſſes to us? <hi>And that we may ſo reſiſt him, as to cauſe his flight from us,</hi> let us imitate the excellent Saint, whoſe Example is ſet before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By poſſeſſing the Soul with a lively and ſolemn Senſe of Gods Preſence, who is the Inſpector and Judge of all our Actions. <hi>Joſeph</hi> repell'd the Temptation with this powerful Thought, <hi>How ſhall I ſin againſt God? The fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> 'tis a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sentinel, that reſiſts Temptations without, and ſuppreſſes Corruptions within: 'Tis like the Cherubim plac'd with a flaming Sword in Paradiſe, to prevent the Re-entry of <hi>Adam</hi> when guilty and polluted. For this end we muſt, by frequent and ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, repreſent the Divine Being and Glory in our Minds, that there may be a gracious Conſtitution of Soul; this will be our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative from Sin: for although the habitual thoughts of God are not always in act, yet upon a Temptation they are preſently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and appear in the view of Conſcience, and are effectual to make us reject the Tempter with Defiance and Indignation.</p>
            <p>This holy Fear is not a meer judicial Impreſſion, that reſtrains from Sin, for the dreadful Puniſhment that follows; for that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile affection, though it may ſtop a Temptation, and hinder the Eruption of a Luſt into the groſs act, yet it does not renew the Nature, and make us Holy and Heavenly. There may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective diſlike of Sin with a direct affection to it. Beſides, a meer ſervile Fear is repugnant to Nature, and will be expell'd if poſſible. Therefore, that we <hi>may be in the fear of the Lord all the day long,</hi> we muſt regard him in his endearing Attributes, his Love, his Goodneſs and Compaſſion, his rewarding Mercy; and this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a filial Fear of Reverence and Caution, leſt we ſhould offend ſo gracious a God. As the natural Life is preſerved by grateful Food, not by Aloes and Wormwood which are uſeful Medicines; ſo the Spiritual Life is maintained by the comfortable Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, as the Rewarder of our Fidelity in all our Trials.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Strip Sin of its Diſguiſes, waſh off its flattering Colours, that you may ſee its native Uglineſs. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s reply to the Tempter, <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs?</hi> Illuſion and Concupiſcence are the Inducements to Sin: When a Luſt repreſents the Temptation as very alluring, and hinders the Reflection of the mind, upon the intrinſick and conſequential Evil of Sin, 'tis like the putting Poiſon into the Glaſs: but when it has ſo far corrupted the mind, that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:122"/> Sin is eſteemed a ſmall Evil, Poiſon is thrown into the Fountain. If we conſider the Majeſty of the Law-giver, there is no Law ſmall, nor Sin ſmall, that is the Tranſgreſſion of it. Yet the moſt are ſecure in an evil courſe, by conceits that their Sins are ſmall. 'Tis true, there is a vaſt difference between Sins in their nature and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: there are inſenſible Omiſſions and accuſing Acts, but the leaſt is Damnable. Beſides, the allowance and number of Sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſmall, will involve under intolerable Guilt. What is lighter than a grain of Sand? you may blow away a hundred with a Breath, and what is heavier than a heap of Sand condenſt together? 'Tis our Wiſdom and Duty to conſider the Evil of Sin in its eſſential Malignity, which implies no leſs, than that God was neither wiſe nor good in making his Law, and that he is not juſt and powerful to vindicate it: And when tempted to any pleaſant Sin, to conſider the due Aggravations of it, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did, which will controle the Efficacy of the Temptation. I ſhall only add, that when a Man has morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the luſts of the fleſh, he has overcom the main part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Army <hi>that Wars againſt the Soul.</hi> Senſual objects do powerfully and pleaſantly inſinuate into carnal Men, and the affections are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly reſtrain'd from them. To undertake the cure of thoſe, whoſe Diſeaſe is their pleaſure, is almoſt a vain attempt: for they do not judge it an evil to be regarded, and will not accept diſtaſtful remedies.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fly all tempting occaſions of ſin. <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not be alone with his Miſtriſs. There is no vertue ſo confirmed, and in that degree of eminence, but if one be frequently ingaged in vicious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, 'tis in danger of being eclipſt and controul'd by the oppoſite vice. If the Ermins will aſſociate with the Swine, they muſt lie in the mire: if the Sheep with Wolves, they muſt learn to bite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: if Doves with Vultures, they muſt learn to live on the prey. Our ſureſt guard is to keep at a diſtance from all engaging ſnares. He that from careleſsneſs or confidence ventures into temptations, makes himſelf an eaſie prey to the tempter.</p>
            <p>And let us dayly pray for the Divine Aſſiſtance to keep us from the evil of the World; without which all our reſolutions will be as ineffectual as ropes of ſand, to bind us to our duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The conſideration of the evil of ſin is a powerful motive to our ſolemn and ſpeedy Repentance. The remembrance of our original and actual ſins, will convince us, that we are born for repentance. There are innumerable ſilent ſins, that are unobſerved and do not Alarm the Conſcience, and altho a true Saint will neither hide any ſin, nor ſuffer ſin to hide it ſelf in his breſt, yet the moſt holy Men in the World, have great reaſon with the Pſalmiſt to ſay with melting affections, <hi>who can underſtand his errors, O clenſe me from my ſecret ſins,</hi> diſcover them to me by the light of the Word, and cover them in the blood of the Redeemer: There are ſins of infirmity and dayly incurſion, from which none can be perfectly freed in this mortal ſtate: theſe ſhould
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40119:122"/> excite our watchfulneſs, and be lamented with true tears: There are crying ſins, of a crimſon guilt, which are to be confeſt with heart-breaking ſorrow, confounding ſhame, and implacable antipathy againſt them, and to be forſaken for ever. Of theſe, ſome are of a deep die in their nature, and ſome from the circumſtances in committing them; ſome are of a heynous nature, and more directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly renounce our duty, and more immediately obſtruct our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. As a mud-wall intercepts the light of the Sun from ſhining upon us. 2. Some derive a greater guilt from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the commiſſion. Such are, 1. Sins againſt knowledge: for according to the ingrediency of the will in ſin, the guilt ariſes. Now when Conſcience interpoſes between the carnal Heart and the temptation, and repreſents the evil of ſin, and deters from compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and yet Men will venture to break the Divine Law, this exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aggravates the offence; for ſuch ſins are committed with a fuller conſent, atd are juſtly called rebellion againſt the light. And the clearer the light is, the more it will increaſe the diſconſolate fearful darkneſs in Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sins committed againſt the Love as well as the Law of God are exceedingly aggravated. To pervert the benefits we receive from God to his diſhonour, to turn them into occaſions of ſin which were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to endear obedience to us, to ſin licentiouſly and ſecurely in hopes of an eaſie pardon at laſt, is intenſive of our guilt in a high degree. This is to poiſon the antidote, and make it deadly. There is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to reconcile offended Juſtice, but if Men obſtinately continue in ſin, and abuſe the Grace of the Goſpel, there is no Sacrifice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe exaſperated Mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sins committed againſt ſolemn promiſes and engagements to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, have a deeper die: for perfidiouſneſs is joyn'd with this diſobedience. The Divine Law ſtrictly binds us to our duty, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to our conſent; but when we promiſe to obey it, we increaſe our obligations, and by ſinning break double chains. In ſhort, any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual allowed ſin, induces a heavy guilt, for it argues a deeper root and foundation of ſin in the Heart, a ſtronger inclination to it, from whence the repeated acts proceed, which are new provocations to the pure Eyes of God. Accordingly in repenting reflections, our ſorrow ſhould be moſt afflicting, our humiliation deeper, our ſelf-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt ſevere for thoſe ſins which have been moſt diſhonourable to God, and defiling to us. Not that we can make any ſatisfaction for our ſins, tho we ſhould fill the Air with our ſighs, and Heaven with our tears, but it becomes us to have our ſorrows inlarged in ſome proportion to our unworthineſs. And this mournful diſpoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares us for the grace of God. The Law does not allow repentance, but exacts entire obedience: 'tis the privilege of the Goſpel that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſinners are aſſur'd of forgiveneſs: without this qualification 'tis inconſiſtent with the Majeſty, Purity, and Juſtice of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:40119:123"/> pardoning Mercy to Sinners: for they will never value, nor humbly and ardently ſeek for Mercy, till they feel the woful effects of ſin in their Conſcience; only the ſtung <hi>Iſraelite</hi> would look to the brazen Serpent: and this is requiſite to prevent our relapſing into ſin: for the dominion of ſin being founded in the love of pleaſure, the proper means to extinguiſh it is by a bitter repentance: the Heart is firſt broken for ſin, and then from it.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Let us renew our repentance every-day: let not the wounds of our Spirits putrifie: <hi>let not the Sun go down upon Gods wrath:</hi> let us always renew the applications of Chriſts blood that alone can cleanſe us from Sin.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E have heard the Queſtion; And, (as I conceive) a due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance unto the words read, may lead us far, toward the Reſolution of it. And, for that reaſon, was this Text choſen. I deſign not, therefore, to frame a ſet Diſcourſe upon it, but only to lay it, as a ground-work, to ſupport that which I have to offer, toward the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of the Queſtion propounded.</p>
            <p>We have, before us then, a ſerious Exhortation, <hi>[Walk in wiſdom, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that are without]</hi> And therein we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſons, to whom the Apoſtle doth direct it: And, they are private Chriſtians. This is apparent; (1.) In that, here is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation given, that he intended any other. Not one of thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are ſet upon them, whereby the Paſtors, or Guides of the Church uſe to be diſtinguiſhed from the Community of Believers. (2.) The Duties, which he exhorts them unto, may undoubtedly, and ought to be performed by private Chriſtians: As, To continue inſtant in prayer, and to watch in the ſame with thankſgiving, <hi>verſe</hi> 2. To pray, in ſpecial, for the Apoſtle himſelf, that he might receive Divine Aſſiſtance, and be bleſſed with ſucceſs, in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 4. To walk in wiſdom, toward them that are without, redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. That their ſpeech be always with grace—<hi>ver.</hi> 6. With all which, the ſame perſons are charged. Now, to walk in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom toward them that are without, is a Duty of a great latitude. And if it comprehend the promoting of their Converſion, and Salvation,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:124"/> (as certainly it doth, having an aptitude, tendency, and efficacy to help it on.) Then muſt private Chriſtians take themſelves to be concerned therein: For, to them is this Exhortation directed. And ſo we have gained a very conſiderable point. That we may, from this Text, charge the Duty upon the Conſciences of private Chriſtians, in the name, and authority of Jeſus Chriſt. 2. We have an account of the Perſons, with reſpect to whom, in a ſpecial manner, private Chriſtians are counſelled [to walk wiſely.] And they are deſcribed by this Periphraſis: [Them that are without] <hi>i. e.</hi> Such as had not as yet entertained the Goſpel, nor profeſſed ſubjection to it, but ſtill continued in a ſtate of Infidelity. This is clear, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 12, 13. <hi>What have I to do, to judge them alſo, that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth.</hi> The ſum whereof is this: That ſcandalous Chriſtians are to be corrected by Church-cenſures, when milder reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies prove ineffectual. But thoſe flagitious perſons, who are out of the Pale of the Church, are to be left to the judgment of God, and of the Civil Magiſtrates. Thus we are advanced one ſtep farther. For we have diſcovered that thoſe to whom private Chriſtians may be very helpful, may be ſuch, as are without. <hi>i. e.</hi> Heathen, or Infidels, and therefore they muſt not caſt off all care of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are to enquire, what is that ſpecial work, and buſineſs, in the diſpoſal, and management whereof, private Chriſtians are charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed [To walk wiſely toward them, that without.] I ſuppoſe, none are ſo weak, as to ſurmize, that the Apoſtles intent, and meaning, was, to caution them, to make ſure, and advantageous bargains, when they traded with Infidels, who being falſe and crafty, might be likely to over-reach them. This was too low, for the Apoſtles Spirit. It was ſomething of a more ſublime import, and tendency, <hi>viz.</hi> To admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and excite private Chriſtians ſo to demean themſelves in all things, that they might beget, even in the Heathen themſelves, a due venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Goſpel, and a love, and liking of that holy Religion, which they profeſſed. And, to enforce this his Counſel, the Apoſtle did ſet them a fair example, in his own practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x 33. <hi>Even as I pleaſe all men, in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi> And hence, we learn further, That private Chriſtians in their negotiations with Heathens, and Infidels ſhould not mind only, the enriching of themſelves, but chiefly, the promoting of the Converſion of thoſe poor miſerable Souls to the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In order to the winning over of Infidels to Chriſt, private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought ſedulouſly, to endeavour to promote the admiſſion of the Goſpel among them. For the Goſpel is the glorious Chariot, in which Chriſt is carried about the World. And, that it may be entertained among them, to procure the Preaching of it to them. For that is Gods method; and the Apoſtles way of reaſoning, is clear, and ſtrong, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 14, 15. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40119:124"/> And how ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent?</hi> Here, then are many things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in private Chriſtians may be very helpful. As in ſeeking out and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing thoſe, who may preach the Goſpel among them: Encouraging, and ſupplying thoſe who give up themſelves to that bleſſed work: In diſpoſing thoſe poor creatures, (as much as they may) toward the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Goſpel, and preventing, or removing all impediments that might obſtruct their entertainment of it. This ſhews us, In what private Chriſtians ſhould deſire, and endeavour to be Helpful, <hi>viz.</hi> In promoting the entertainment of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The laſt thing (the former four being eſtabliſhed and admitted) is to enquire, How private Chriſtians may be moſt helpful herein? The Text gives a general Direction when it enjoyns them to walk in wiſdom, toward them that are without. And this will adminiſter to us occaſion, to lay out this general direction, more diſtinctly, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. Thus, I hope, the opening of the Text hath reflected ſome light upon the Queſtion, and all that I have to offer may be gathered up in this Obſervation:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Private Chriſtians, walking in wiſdom, toward them them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, may be exceeding helpfu l, to promote the entertainment of the Goſpel among them.</hi> This, they may do and more. For they may be helpful to promote their Converſion, and Salvation. To further the entertainment of the Goſpel among them, is but the Means: To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Converſion, and Salvation is the End. And the Means are for the end. Now, it is expreſly affirmed, That a Private Believer may ſave an Infidel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 16. <hi>For what knoweſt thou, O Wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Husband? Or, how knoweſt thou, O Man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Wife? i. e.</hi> The believing party may be induced to cohabit with the unbeliever, upon a hopeful proſpect, that it is poſſible to conquer them by love, to attract them to have an eſteem for holineſs, by an exemplary converſation, and to obtain Gods grace for them, by ardent prayers, and ſo be the Means of ſaving their Souls. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Chriſtian Women, who were yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unbelievers, to become eminent for their Modeſty, Chaſtity, Humility and Reſpectfulneſs to their Husbands, by the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 1, 2. <hi>Likewiſe, ye Wives, be in Subjection to your own Husbands, that if any obey not the word, they alſo may, without the word, be won by the converſation of their Wives: while they behold your chaſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, coupled with fear.</hi> Chriſtian graces being ſo exerciſed, that they may be ſeen, in their proper luſter, are excellent Orators, and have a mighty power to perſwade. It is more to live vertue, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it. Let me have leave to ſay to women profeſſing godlineſs, (as the Apoſtle ſtiles them, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> ii. 10.) O, live to ſuch an eminent pitch of holineſs, that ye may raiſe an admiration of you, in the judgments of ſuch, as otherwiſe, would have no great reverence for religion, and
<pb facs="tcp:40119:125"/> give them occaſion to ſay (as it is reported that <hi>Libanius</hi> an Heathen Philoſopher, did) <hi>Proh, Quales faeminas habent Chriſtiani!</hi> Oh, what excellent women have theſe Chriſtians!</p>
            <p>The Correſpondence between the Text, and the Queſtion, having been (as I think) ſufficiently inſiſted upon; I ſhall now apply my ſelf, to give a direct, and ſatisfactory anſwer, to the Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And that I may ſpeak to it, the more intelligibly, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſons mentioned in it; and they are [private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.]</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Duty, and work; and that is [to be helpful, to promote the entertainment of the Goſpel.]</p>
            <p n="3">3 The way, that they are to take, and the Means that they are to make uſe, of, that they may be moſt helpful, in the carrying on of that bleſſed work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſons ſpecified. And they are [private Chriſtians.] In which, is intimated, (1.) Their general Character [as Chriſtians] (2.) The reſtrictive term that is added, to denote their ſpecial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, as they are [private Chriſtians] which limits our Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or calls on us, to ſpeak more ſpecially, at leaſt, of the Duty, and work of private Chriſtians, in the undertaking mentioned in the Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is ſuppoſed, That Chriſtians only, will be willing, or proper to be made uſe of, in this holy work. We may conclude, that they who reject the Goſpel, and put away Salvation from them, (as thoſe did, who are mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.) will never (while they continue in that temper, and diſpoſition) promote the entertainment of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but will endeavour, to obſtruct, and hinder it.</p>
            <p>But all Chriſtians (in the moſt comprehenſive latitude) both ſtand obliged in point of Duty, and may alſo, Eventually, be helpful, to promote the ſpreading of the Goſpel, even every one, who nameth the name of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 19. Or, that is called by his name, as, <hi>Jer.</hi> xiv. 8. Even, thoſe Chriſtians as are ſuch, only by External pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, tho they remain deſtitute, of Internal, and Real Sanctification, may be helpful herein, by their common Gifts, their Intereſts, their Services, and by contributing their Aſſiſtance, and Encouragement, to thoſe, who are engaged in this holy work. And they may be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by ſuch Motives, and Inducements, as may excite, and engage them thereunto. Such as theſe (for ought I know) may be admitted to contribute their help to Build the Temple of the Lord, and are not to be excluded. For, probably, Chriſts Aphoriſm, <hi>Mark</hi> ix. 40. <hi>He that is not againſt us, is on our part,</hi> may be underſtood of ſuch. But, how far ſuch may be Accepted, or Rewarded, falls not under our preſent Enquiry. This, I preſume, will be admitted by all, That ſuch only as are Chriſtians indeed (as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Nathanael, John</hi> i. 47. Behold an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> indeed) are the only Perſons, who are rightly principled
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40119:125"/> and will be found ſincerely affected to this bleſſed work, and will be moſt vigorouſly Active, in carrying it on. This may ſuffice touching the Perſons, under their general Character, as [Chriſtians.]</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Their ſpecial circumſtance, as they are [Private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans] whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from ſuch as are inveſted with publick Offices. Such are Chriſtian Rulers, and Magiſtrates, who are the Miniſters of God, who bear the Sword; and ſuch as are called to preach the Goſpel, who are Miniſters of the Word. I confeſs, theſe come not, directly, within the compaſs of our Queſtion, for that concerns [Private Chriſtians;] neither yet ought they wholly to be excluded out of it: becauſe they are Chriſtians, and therefore are not ſilently to be paſſed over. And ſo I ſhall ſay ſomething, yet but little of them. Doubtleſs, both Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and Miniſters of the Goſpel, are as much obliged, in point of Duty, to promote the entertainment of the Goſpel, as private Chriſtians; and they may do more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have greater Advantages put into their hands; for that is a Rule, laid down by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> xii. 48. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) For Chriſtian Rulers, when their Hearts are throughly knit to Chriſt, in Faith, and Love, and they act upon Goſpel-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and according to the Rules thereof, what wonderful things may they perform, toward the enlargement of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the World? If a poor Bond-ſlave, who lies in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rank of men, may, in his Station, ſerve the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 24. What eminent ſervices may Princes, and Potentates do him, who are placed in the higheſt rank of men, and dignified with the title of Gods? The zeal of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. for the Chriſtian Religion, is praiſed by more, than are diſpoſed to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it. But when thoſe who have given their Strength, and Power to the Beaſt, ſhall hate the Whore, and make her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and devote their Crowns, and Scepters to the Lamb, we may hope for thoſe bleſſed days, wherein the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſhall ſhine forth ſo gloriouſly, as to illuſtrate the whole World. This ſhould excite all Private Chriſtians, to pray hard, that God would put it into the Hearts of Kings, and thoſe who are in Authority, to kiſs the Son, by whom they reign.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As for the Miniſters of the Goſpel; all they who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and attend unto their Office and Duty, muſt acknowledge; that they are under the ſtricteſt, and moſt forcible engagements in the World, to lay out themſelves entirely, and (to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of their Capacity) to ſerve the Lord Jeſus, and to help forward the enlargement of his Kingdom. And yet, it is not the Duty, and Work of every ordinary Miniſter to go up and down the World, to preach the Goſpel, for the Converſion of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:126"/> the Heathen, as the Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts did. [<hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 20. <hi>Yea, ſo have I ſtrived to preach the Goſpel, where Chriſt was not named.</hi>] Becauſe they are commanded by Chriſt, to attend upon their proper flocks, <hi>Act.</hi> xx. 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 1, 2. But, what Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they are to take farther, or what Methods, they are to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, to promote the ſpreading of the Goſpel, is indeed, a very Chriſtian, and noble enquiry. At the debate whereof, I ſhould moſt gladly ſtand, as a ſilent Learner, and not preſume to be a Director. However, I hope, it will be excuſable, if I offer one thing to the Conſideration of thoſe whoſe Piety, and Learning may challenge a due eſteem in the Hearts of all that fear God. We have had among us, Committees for the Encouragement, and Increaſe of Trade. And what if there were ſome to conſult, How the Goſpel might be propagated? The Papiſts have at <hi>Rome</hi> their <hi>Congregatio de propagandâ Fide.</hi> Their deſign may be very ill, while they contrive not, How that Faith, which was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints, may be propagated; but how the Leven of their own Superſtition may be diffuſed, and eſpecially, How the Popes Kingdom may be enlarged. And yet, to deliberate, How the Goſpel of the Grace of God, may be carried into the dark corners of the Earth for the Converſion, and Salvation of them who are ready to periſh, and ſo the Kingdom of Chriſt get ground in the World, is, I am ſure, a moſt holy, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſign; and ſo I recommend this alſo to the Prayers of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, private Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Theſe few things being ſuggeſted touching thoſe Chriſtians, who bear a Publick Character, I, now, ſhall addreſs my ſelf to all Godly, Private Chriſtians; and I muſt exhort, and beſeech them, with all the fervour I can, to ſet their hearts ſincerely, upon this glorious work, and to beſtir themſelves in it with all their might. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to every Chriſtian, as ſuch, in what circumſtances ſoever the Providence of God doth diſpoſe of them, whether they be High, or Low; Noble, or Baſe; Rich, or Poor; Learned, or Unlearned; Male, or Female: None are to be excluded, or exempted.</p>
            <p>But, it is likely, This may ſeem ſtrange to many Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. That they ſhould be charged, in the Name of Chriſt, to be helpful, to promote the ſpreading of the Goſpel all the world over. Alas! will one ſay, (with the Eunuch) I am a dry tree, and no ſuch fruit is to be expected from me. And I (will another ſay) am but a Cypher, and make no Figure in the world (as the Phraſe goes) and therefore, I can ſignifie nothing. But, let me beſeech all Private Chriſtians, to take heed of ſhifting off from themſelves, any Duty, or Service, that Chriſt calls them to, or would employ them in. And, To ſuſpend their Determination a little, until I have ſhewed them (as Chriſt ſhall enable me) How, and wherein, Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may be helpful, in this Great, and Good work. And then, I
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:40119:126"/> hope, they will ſee, That they may do much more therein, than, poſſibly, they have, hitherto, apprehended.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing mentioned, is, Their Duty, and Work. Which is, To be helpful in promoting the Entertainment of the Goſpel. And the third thing, is, How, or in what ways, and by what means, they may be moſt helpful in it. But (for diſpatch ſake) I ſhall ſpeak, to both theſe, Conjunctly.</p>
            <p>Now, That I may proceed herein, the more clearly, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I think it may be uſeful, to place Private Chriſtians, according to their ſeveral Circumſtances, and Capacities (as to the matter now under conſideration) in three Ranks, or Orders.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are many Private Chriſtians, who live very remote from ſuch Places, and People, as have not the Goſpel preached unto them: Or, at leaſt, have not, hitherto, entertained it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are ſome Private Chriſtians, who may, Occaſionally, go into, or may, Providentially, be caſt, into ſuch Places.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are ſome Private Chriſtians, who live among ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in a more fixed, or conſtant Reſidence; As, In our Factories abroad; Or, In our Plantations in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or other Heathen places.</p>
            <p>Now, Tho' it be the Duty of all Private Chriſtians, To promote the entertainment of the Goſpel; yet all cannot take the ſame Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, nor be Active in the ſame ways. And therefore, it may be to very good purpoſe, To let each of them to ſee, wherein their Proper work doth lie, That they may contribute their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, accordingly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Moſt of the Private Chriſtians, among us, live very Remote from thoſe People, who have not, as yet, entertained the Goſpel. And ſo, They cannot be helpful unto them, by Perſonal inſtruction, or counſel: Neither can they attract them by the Example of their holy converſation. And yet, they may greatly contribute toward the promoting of the entertainment of the Goſpel among them. And that they may do, ſeveral ways, <hi>e. gr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They may, and ought to pray in Faith. That the Goſpel may be ſent among them. That it may be Received by them. And be bleſſed to the Converſion, and Salvation, of all that are ordained to Eternal life, among them. For ſuch Prayers, being according to the Will of God, They may be confident, that he heareth them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 14. And that God requireth, and expecteth ſuch Prayers from them, cannot be unknown to any, who acquaint themſelves with the Scriptures. For, (1.) Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this matter to the Prayers of private Chriſtians, <hi>Matth.</hi> ix. 37, 38. <hi>Then, ſaith he unto his Diſciples, The harveſt truly is plenteous, but the Labourers are few. Pray ye therefore to the Lord of the harveſt, that he will ſend forth Labourers into his harveſt.</hi> Here we may take notice, (1.) That by the Metaphor, or Allegory of an Harveſt our Saviour
<pb facs="tcp:40119:127"/> would inſtruct us, That, as when the Corn is ripe, Men uſe to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Reapers, to cut it down, and gather it in: So there are ſome bleſſed Seaſons, wherein God hath decreed, to ſend the Goſpel among a People, and accordingly prepares, and diſpoſeth them for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it, and raiſeth in them a propenſity, and ſtrong affection toward it. Thus it was, when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came, and Preached, That the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand, <hi>Matth.</hi> iii. 2. and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in <hi>verſe</hi> the 5th, <hi>Then went out unto him,</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and all</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the region round about</hi> Jordan. And our Saviour ſets a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon that time, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 12. <hi>And from the days of</hi> John <hi>the Baptist until now, the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent take it by force.</hi> When, therefore, ye hear, That the Day of the Goſpel, begins to Dawn, in any of the dark corners of the Earth, Then, Lift up a Prayer, That the Grace and Power of the Spirit, may accompany it, and make it ſucceſsful. (2.) Our Saviour teacheth you to pray, That the Labourers may be increaſed, proportionably to the work; as when he ſaith, <hi>[The Harvest is plenteous, but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers are few.]</hi> Pray then, that God would imploy ſuch as are Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and Induſtrious; ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 15. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth;</hi> And pray, That God would imploy ſuch a number of them, as is ſufficient for the work. A Reverend Perſon among us, hath, for many years, complained, That, in many places, where there is but One to labour in the Miniſterial Work, there is enough for three, or four, tho' all of them be very induſtrious. But it ſeems that Men either cannot, or will not make better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. (3.) Private Chriſtians, when they perceive, How the caſe ſtands, ſhould be importunate with God, that he would ſend forth Labourers into his harveſt. <hi>[Send them]</hi> by the Efficacious word of his Power. [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>ut ejiciat, vel extrudat.</hi>] Thruſt them out by his Grace working in them, and his Providence ordering of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances concerning them. It is no wonder if Fleſh and Blood ſhrink from the employment of carrying the Lord's Meſſage to a barbarous people. <hi>Moſes</hi> would fain have been excuſed, from going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he multiplied Evaſions, and Pretences, till the Lord was angry with him, <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 10, 11, 14. and Chap. iv. 1, 10, 13. When the Lord ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach the Goſpel among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he might hearten him, for that difficult, and dangerous work, he promiſed him Protection, <hi>Act.</hi> xxvi. 17, 18. <hi>Delivering thee from the People—to whom I now ſend thee: To open their eyes</hi>—They ſtand in need of a mighty preſence of God with them, who have juſt cauſe to fear, That thoſe people will ſeek their death, to whom they bring the word of Life, and Salvation. I thought this Scripture ſo appoſite to the matter in hand, and ſo directive to private Chriſtians, that it may plead my excuſe for this enlargement upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That Private Chriſtians may be ſure to mind it, our Saviour
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40119:127"/> hath put it into the Rule of Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.10. <hi>[Thy Kingdom come.]</hi> I have read, That it is one of the <hi>Jews</hi> Maxims, touching Prayer; <hi>Iſta Oratio, in quâ non eſt memoria regni Dei, non eſt Oratio:</hi> That Prayer, in which there is no mention made of the Kingdom of God, is no Prayer at all; when we pray <hi>[Thy Kingdom come]</hi> we beg, That the Goſpel, which is the Rod of Chriſt's Power, and the Scepter of his Government, may ſpread all the world over. For where the Goſpel is believed, and obeyed, there doth Chriſt reign over fallen Man, as Mediator.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Saints, under the Old Teſtament, prayed for the Calling, and Converſion of the Gentiles, under the Goſpel-diſpenſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> lxvii. 2, 3. <hi>That thy way may be known upon Earth, thy ſaving health among all Nations. Let the people praiſe thee, O God; Let all the people praiſe thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) When, by the Preaching of the Goſpel, in any place, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were wrought upon, and brought to Believe in Chriſt, They were exhorted to pray, That the Word of the Lord might be carried to all other parts of the Gentile-world, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iii. 1. <hi>Finally, Brethren, Pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, even as it is with you.</hi> And ſuch Prayers are not to be thought to be loſt, or put up to God in vain. That Prediction, or Promiſe [<hi>Rom.</hi> xvi. 20. <hi>And the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet, ſhortly</hi>] did, doubtleſs excite many a Prayer; and That Promiſe was eminently accompliſhed, and thoſe Prayers which were grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and put up to God, in faith, took effect, when the Kingdom of Satan (adminiſtred in the Idolatries of the Gentiles) was laid waſte, and the Chriſtian Profeſſion was advanced by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. Having now, ſo inviting an occaſion offered to me, give me leave to preſent a Requeſt to you, and it ſhall be, in the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 25. <hi>Brethren, Pray for us;</hi> for thoſe who labour among you, in the Word, and Doctrin. And, I hope, I may, without vanity, enforce this Requeſt, by the ſame Apoſtles Argument, or Motive, <hi>Hebr.</hi> xiii. 18. <hi>Pray for us: for we truſt we have a good conſcience, in all things, willing to live honeſtly.</hi> Many reflect upon us with diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we are very ſenſible of our own many, and great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But, Help us with your Prayers, That we may Be better, Live better, and Preach better. It is no Paradox, but a well-weighed Truth, That a godly private Chriſtian, upon his knees, in his Cloſet, may aſſiſt the Miniſter, in his Study, and in the Pulpit. And that I may prevail in my Requeſt, I can aſſure you, That whatſoever Gifts, or Graces, ye obtain of God, for your Miniſters, by your Prayers, they will come as Bleſſings upon your ſelves; like the vapours that riſe from the Earth, being concocted in the Middle-Region, fall down upon it again, in fruitful ſhowers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 21, 22. <hi>For all things are yours; whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas—If any ſay, This is a Digreſſion from the Caſe which I was to ſpeak to, I would
<pb facs="tcp:40119:128"/> entreat them to conſider, what is the general ſcope, and deſign of it, and they will find, That it comports very well with it. Once, I am ſure, That it is as much the Duty, and Concernment of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to pray for the Succeſs of the Goſpel, that it may be bleſſed to the Converſion, and Salvation of Souls, in <hi>England,</hi> as that it may be preached, entertained, believed, and obeyed, in the uttermoſt parts of the Earth. And ſo, I will return, to proſecute my Diſcourſe with two Remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That, From what hath been ſaid, touching the Prayers of private Chriſtians for the ſpreading of the Goſpel, we may be aſſured, That God hath determined to beſtow thoſe Mercies, for which he commands his people, to pray. And more than That, He uſually beſtows them, in the diſpoſal of his Providence, upon the intervention of his Peoples Prayers, as may be collected from <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 25. <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs,</hi> — ver. 27. <hi>I will put my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes.</hi> — ver. 30. <hi>I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increaſe of the Field.</hi> — compared with ver. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet for this, be enquired of, by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That no godly private Chriſtian can object againſt his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in praying that the Goſpel may be carried to all Nations, and be entertained by them, nor alledge any excuſe, or pretence, why they ſhould be exempted from it. If any heſitate, let me expoſtulate the matter with their Conſciences. Have ye received the Spirit of Chriſt, as the Spirit of Grace, and Supplication, and can ye not pray? Do ye feel the Love of Chriſt, warming, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and conſtraining your hearts, and will ye not pray? ye dearly value the Glory of God, and ſincerely deſire, That the earth may be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea: And can ye refrain from praying, that this may be performed? ye tenderly compaſſionate the miſerable condition of Poor, Periſhing Souls, and will ye not afford them ſo much as your Prayers, that they may be relieved? Are ye not greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God, in bringing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to you, and opening your Hearts to receive it? How, then, Can ye offer up your Praiſes to God, for ſo ſignal a Mercy, without making ſome reflection on the deplorable ſtate of thoſe who have not, as yet, obtained the like favour, without lifting up a Prayer for them, that they may be made partakers of the ſame Grace?</p>
            <p>Or will ye reply, That you do pray indeed, That God would viſit the heathen World with the Goſpel of Salvation: But ye cannot think, that your Prayers will contribute much toward ſo great, and good a work. Suffer me to debate this alſo, a little, with you. Why will you reproach the Spirit, and Grace of Prayer,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:40119:128"/> in ſaying, it can avail little, or nothing, when God himſelf, ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The effectual, fervent Prayer of a Righteous man availeth much?</hi> Thoſe Prayers, which can mount as high as Heaven, are able alſo, to reach the ends of the Earth. Why will ye, by your diſobedience, (as much as in you lies) make void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt? Doth not He expreſly charge you, <hi>To pray to the Lord of the Harveſt, that he would ſend forth Labourers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Harveſt?</hi> And, to pray, That his Kingdom may come? And, will ye ſay, That the Lord Chriſt, doth injoin his Servants to do that, which is inſignificant, and impertinent? Why will you, by your unbelief, go about to make the Promiſes of God of none effect? When as, he himſelf hath aſſured us, That, <hi>He will fulfil the</hi> (regular) <hi>deſires of them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. cxlv. 18, 19. And that, whatſoever <hi>we ask, according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> 1 Joh. v. 14. For ever then, beware of entertaining that Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is formed and cheriſhed in the hearts of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Who ſay unto God — <hi>What profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> Job xxi. 14, 15. I ſhall cloſe this, when I have added, That were the Prayers of private, godly, Chriſtians more frequent, intenſe, and importunate, for the ſpreading of the Goſpel, it would be an hopeful indication, that the Goſpel is about, through the bleſſing of God, to find better entertainment in the World, than it hath done, of later years.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to have been ſpoken, touching the firſt way, and means, wherein private Chriſtians, who live remote from thoſe places, where the Goſpel is not entertained, may be helpful to promote the ſpreading of it, that it may be brought to them, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Prayers, which they put up to God, in Faith, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond way, and means, whereby private Chriſtians, who live remote from thoſe places, whither the Goſpel is not yet come, may promote the reception of it, among them, is, By a ready, chearful, and liberal contribution of ſupplies, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them, who labour in that holy work. And, here, the different Abilities, and Capacities of private Chriſtians are to be conſidered. They who are rich, may caſt in much, into the Lords Treaſury; and, for the proportion, the Apoſtles Rule, and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould be attended unto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 2. <hi>[Every one, as God hath proſpered him.]</hi> When the Tabernacle was to be made, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one brought ſomething. They who had gold, ſilver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, offered them; they who could bring but rams-skins, and badgers skins, were accepted. And thoſe good Women, who had nothing to bring, did, yet, ſpin with their hands, and brought that which they had ſpun, and they alſo were accounted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded among the Contributers. What private Chriſtian is there, who can afford Nothing? They who ſubſiſt by the labour of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:129"/> their hands ſhould ſpare ſomething for works of Piety, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 28.</p>
            <p>To excite, and encourage you, to comply with this Direction, I ſhall lay before you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeveral Examples, which will ſhew you, how Practical, and Acceptable a work, this is. (1.) Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were helpful to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, in the days of his fleſh, upon Earth. Tho all things were made by him, and he upholds them by the Word of his power, and ſo the Earth is His, and the fulneſs thereof, yet, for our ſakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he became poor, and was pleaſed to receive proviſions, for his ſubſiſtence from ſome godly women, who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to him of their ſubſtance, <hi>Luk.</hi> viii. 1, 2, 3. (2.) The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> records it, to the praiſe of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> That they were careful of him, and made proviſion for him, not only, when he laboured among them, and when he was in Bonds for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, (And I heartily wiſh, that all private Chriſtians, among us, yea, and ſuch as glory in their profeſſion, would keep pace with them, ſo far,) but alſo, when he was employed in the ſervice of the Lord, among ſuch as were, then, ſtrangers to Chriſt, and the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 15, 16. <hi>Now ye Philippians, know alſo, that, in the beginning of the Goſpel, when I departed from</hi> Macedonia, <hi>no Church communicated with me, as concerning Giving, and Receiving, but ye only. For even in</hi> Theſſalonica <hi>ye ſent once, and again, to my neceſſity.</hi> (3.) St. <hi>John</hi> drawing up the fair character of <hi>Gaius,</hi> a private Chriſtian, placeth this, as a beautiful flower in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, That he was hoſpitable, and liberal to thoſe who for Chriſts names ſake, went forth (preaching the Goſpel) among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> taking nothing of them, 2 Ep. <hi>John</hi> ver. 5.6, 7. Let private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians take notice, that the name of <hi>Gaius,</hi> and his Charity, are regiſtred in the ſacred Scripture, and if their diſpoſition, and practice, be like to his, theirs alſo ſhall be written, in Chriſts book of remembrance, <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 41, 42. <hi>He that receiveth</hi> (and ſo he that encourageth) <hi>a Prophet, in the name of a Prophet, ſhall receive a Prophets reward.</hi> (4) Take notice, that it ſtands as a Blot in the Eſcutcheon of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they were altogether for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Gratuitum Evangelium.</hi> A Goſpel that ſhould coſt them nothing. <hi>Corinth</hi> was the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and ſo the moſt frequented Port, for Trade, in all <hi>Greece.</hi> The Inhabitants are ſaid, to have been very Wealthy, Proud, and Voluptuous. They had abundance to ſpend upon Themſelves, but could find nothing for <hi>Paul,</hi> while he reſided among them, and preached the Goſpel to them. For this, the Apoſtle makes a very mild, but a very cloſe reflection upon them, enough to make their Conſciences to ſtart, if they had any Spiritual life, and ſenſe; and their Faces to bluſh, if they retained any ſparks of Ingenuity in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 8, 9. <hi>I robbed other Churches, taking
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40119:129"/> wages of them, to do you Service; For, when I was preſent with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man, for, that which was lacking to me, the Brethren which came from</hi> Macedonia <hi>ſupplyed.</hi> It is a ſad word, but too frequently experienced; That a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt may Labour, and yet Live in want, in a wealthy City. And, I think, it cannot be rationally ſuppoſed, that ſuch as ſuffer thoſe to want, who labour among them, will be very forward, with their purſes, to aſſiſt them who preach the Goſpel to Infidels, in the remote parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Upon this Head, give me leave to ſay a little, as I did upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>London</hi> doth out-ſhine <hi>Corinth</hi> in Trade. God grant that it may ſtill flouriſh in wealth, and yet be preſerved from thoſe Vices, which are the uſual Attendants of it. May <hi>London</hi> ever have the <hi>Corinthians</hi> advantages, and the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſpirit. It will be, I hope, to the praiſe of God, and of many of <hi>Londons</hi> Citizens, to Recollect what hath been done here, to help on, the propagation of the Goſpel, in <hi>New-England;</hi> and I hope alſo, that the care of that work is not extinct, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, as there may be a neceſſity, and opportunity for it. When I ſhewed how private Chriſtians might he helpful, to promote the Goſpel, by their Prayers, I made a Requeſt to you, that ye would not fail to befriend thoſe who preach it at home, with your prayers, that they may receive grace, and aſſiſtance from God, and be bleſſed with Succeſs. And now, I ſhall take the liberty, to preſent another, to you, in the behalf of many, who preach the Goſpel among us; your Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions for <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Collection made at <hi>Pinners-hall,</hi> for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of ſeveral poor Miniſters, in the Country, hath afforded matter of rejoicing to many: And, I doubt not, have drawn forth many praiſes, and prayers to God, on your behalf; and let me beſeech you, be not weary of well-doing, in this Inſtance. The Apoſtle found, that Profeſſors are as likely to faint, and tire, in works of Charity (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be frequent) as in any Chriſtian duty whatſoever, and therefore, he fixeth his Counſel, and Encouragement there, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 9. <hi>And let us not be weary of well doing, for in due ſeaſon, we ſhall reap, if we faint not.</hi> Bear with me, if, in ſpecial, I commend to your care, thoſe whom the Providence of God hath diſpoſed of, in good Market-Towns, and Corporations. Poſſibly, ſome may think, that ſuch are well enough provided for. But many find, that the Corinthian temper hath not left the World. Even in good Towns, Miniſters may Preach, and want. I think, I ſhall not ſpeak beſide the purpoſe, if I ſhut up this with, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 8. He that provideth not for his own, is worſe than an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to have been ſpoken touching the ſecond means, whereby private Chriſtians, (who live remote from ſuch places, as have not entertained the Goſpel) may be helpful toward the bringing of it, among them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third way, wherein private Chriſtians (who live far from
<pb facs="tcp:40119:130"/> thoſe places, where the Goſpel is not entertained) may be helpful, to promote the admiſſion of it, among them, is to uſe their intereſt in thoſe, who on ſeveral occaſions, may go to ſuch places, by importunate perſwaſions, and pertinent directions, to excite them, to carry a Love, and Zeal for Chriſt, in their own hearts, and from that principle, to act to the uttermoſt of their capacity, for the ſpreading of his Goſpel, and the enlargement of his Kingdom. It was (I think) a good deſign of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> who (as he tells us) wrote his Book, Of the verity of the Chriſtian Religion, for the uſe of his Country-men, who Sail to the uttermoſt ends of the Earth, to furniſh them with proper Arguments, which might leave a due impreſſion thereof, upon the hearts of the poor Heathen. Private Chriſtians may alſo write to their friends, who live abroad, to endeavour to convince the miſerable Captives of Satan, that their Idols are vanities. This courſe did the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> take, to excite, and direct the Jews, who were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> how they ſhould deal with thoſe among whom the providence of God had caſt them, <hi>Jer.</hi> x. 11. <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay to them; The Gods who have not made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Earth, even they ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under the Heavens.</hi> It is obſerved by learned men, that this verſe is written in the Chaldee tongue, tho the reſt of the book be written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, whereby, he doth, as it were, put the words into their mouths, that they might ſpeak to them, in their own language, ſo as to be underſtood by them, and by this, he doth inſtruct us, That it is not ſufficient for the worſhipers of the true God, to keep themſelves from the pollutions of Idols: but they muſt do more, for they muſt make Profeſſion of the true God, and his worſhip. The like courſe may private Chriſtians take, to promote the converſion of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Earthly, and Profane, at home, with whom they have no perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal converſe, and that is, To ſtir up others, who have that advantage, to deal with them, about the everlaſting concernments of their Souls. Thus I have ſpoken ſomething touching the caſe of ſuch private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as come within the firſt Circumſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as live remote from the places, where the Goſpel is not entertained, and in what ways they may be helpful in order to their reception of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed to conſider the caſe of ſuch private Chriſtians, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, or providentially, are brought among thoſe people, which have not entertained the Goſpel; and to ſhew, how they may be helpful, in bringing them into acquaintance with the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Let none pretend, that becauſe this work doth, ſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Miniſters of Chriſt, that, thereupon, private Chriſtians, are exempted, or diſcharged from that which God hath made their Duty. Let none think to excuſe themſelves, by ſaying, They are not learned: for they are a Reproach to Chriſtianity, who have not learned the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of their Religion; and the enforcing, and inculcating of theſe, muſt lead the way in the Converſion of Infidels. Let none ſay, They have enough to do, to mind their own buſineſs: For, I doubt not, but
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40119:130"/> if they minded the Intereſt of Chriſt more, their own would proſper the better. But if they drive on any Deſign, that is contrary to the Faith, or Precepts of the Goſpel, it will be found their Duty, and ſafety, to extricate themſelves out of it, as ſoon, as they can. If they ſuggeſt, that it would be a vain thing for them to expect, or attempt to do any good among Infidels: That will be found to be only the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards Plea; <hi>There is a Lion in the way, Prov.</hi> xxvi. 13. He who hath no heart to an undertaking, will not fail to lay, in his own way, huge Mountains of inſuperable difficulties. But, to prevent, or remove all Evaſions, it ſhall be proved, that among private Chriſtians (if we may judge by circumſtances, or viſible appearance) few or none, (if they really be ſuch as they profeſs themſelves) do labour under ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or improbabilities of ſucceeding in their attempts of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Chriſt, and his Goſpel, as many of thoſe were under, whom, yet, the Lord made uſe of, and eventually bleſſed, in communicating the knowledge of Himſelf, to ſuch as were, before, ſtrangers to him. To manifeſt this, I ſhall produce four Examples; two out of the holy Scriptures, and two out of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. Out of the holy Scriptures, one ſhall be out of the Old Teſtament, the other out of the New. Out of the Old Teſtament, it is ſurprizing and aſtoniſhing to obſerve what a glorious work, the Lord brought about, by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of a little captive Maid, whom the <hi>Syrians</hi> had brought out of the Land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Read 2 <hi>Kings</hi> v. 2, 3. to <hi>verſe</hi> 19. The brief ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary whereof is this; The poor, little Girl, waiting on her Lady, dropt a few words, [<hi>Would God, my Lord were with the Prophet in</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria! <hi>for he would recover him of his Leproſie.</hi>] Another takes up thoſe words, and reports them to <hi>Naaman.</hi> Many ſuch Diſcourſes are brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and expire in the ſame moment. The more wonderful is the conduct of Gods Providence, who worketh all things according to the counſel of his will. I may accommodate to this caſe, what was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon a very different account, <hi>James</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Behold, how great a matter, a little ſpark kindled!</hi> For, by various ſteps, the Converſion of <hi>Naaman</hi> was, at laſt, accompliſhed; and, conſidering his Character, and Intereſt, we may probably conjecture, that his Example, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel might prevail with others alſo, to turn from Idols, and to ſerve the living and true God. We cannot well paſs by this ſtrange, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtance, without ſtaying ſo long as to obſerve, (1.) That this little Girl appears to have been ſeaſoned with the knowledge of the True God, and to have been acted, in what ſhe ſaid, by a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Faith. This ſhe ſhewed by her confidence, That God would work a miracle, by his own Prophet, and Servant <hi>Eliſha;</hi> for it was He whom ſhe intended, as the ſequel diſcovers. <hi>Samaria</hi> was then, like <hi>Athens,</hi> a City wholly given to Idolatry; therein had <hi>Ahab</hi> built an Altar, and an Houſe for <hi>Baal,</hi> and he had four hundred, and fifty Prieſts to attend his Worſhip. The Inhabitants may well be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been, generally, of the Court-Religion, only ſome few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
<pb facs="tcp:40119:131"/> to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and they, it's likely, in a more private way. We read of the good Woman of <hi>Shunem,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> iv. 22, 23. that was one of his Diſciples; and this Girl ſeems to have been of that way. Happy are thoſe young ones, upon whom the Fear of God, makes early impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. (2.) God opened the way to <hi>Naamans</hi> Converſion, by a little Maid. The weaker the Means, the more is Gods Power glorified. (3.) A few good words dropt occaſionally, may operate very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, eſpecially when they are ſuitable, and ſeaſonable, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxv. 11. Let private Chriſtians mind this. (4.) A poor, little Maid carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity, opened the way to the Converſion of one of the greateſt Perſonages in the Countrey. It is very lamentable to hear ſo frequently of Men, and Women, Boys, and Girls, carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, by Turks, and Tartars. But who can tell, whether God may not, in his own good time, by ſome or other of them, convey the knowledge of Chriſt to ſome periſhing Souls? This may ſuffice touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Example produced out of the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>The Example out of the New Teſtament, ſhall be of thoſe who were driven out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the perſecution that followed the Martyrdom of <hi>Stephen,</hi> of whom ye may read, <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 4. <hi>[Therefore they who were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching the Word]</hi> in the ſtrange countries whither providence led them, and a wonderful bleſſing went along with them, as ye may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Now they who were ſcattered abroad upon the perſecution, that aroſe about</hi> Stephen, <hi>travelled as far as</hi> Phenice.— <hi>Which when they were come to</hi> Antioch, <hi>ſpake unto the</hi> Grecians, <hi>preaching the Lord Jeſus. And the hand of the Lord was with them; And a great multitude believed and turned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</hi> Theſe were private Chriſtians, for any thing that appears to the contrary. And, what they did, was no more, than every private Chriſtian Regularly may, and, in duty, ought to do, if the Criticiſm of the late learned Annotator, be allowed, who ſaith, That tho <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> do Materially ſignifie the ſame thing: Yet, perhaps, they differ in the manner. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a work that lies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; any Chriſtian may publiſh the glad tidings of the Goſpel, and give a Relation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which was permitted to be done by Women them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to proclaim the Goſpel, as Heraulds, appointed, and authorized thereunto by Jeſus Chriſt. This is proper to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, and belongs to their Office. Upon this, I ſhall leave one Remark only, That it were greatly to be wiſhed, that all ſuch as for their adherence to the Goſpel, are, by perſecution, driven from their Habitations, and Countries, were perſons of the ſame Spirit with thoſe who were ſcattered abroad from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuch as bring the Grace, and word of God with them, whitherſoever they come; ſo would they prove great Bleſſings to all that receive them. This may ſuffice to have been ſpoken of the New-Teſtament inſtance.</p>
            <p>To the examples, taken out of the Holy Scriptures, I ſhall ſubjoin
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40119:131"/> two alſo, out of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. The one is related by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who gives this account of the Converſion of the Kingdom of the <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> to the Faith. There was, ſaith he, a certain poor woman, who had been taken Captive, and lived among them. She was, at firſt, taken notice of, for her Sobriety, and Modeſty: and then, for her ſpending ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ime in Prayer. Theſe raiſed a great admiration of her in the minds of the Barbarians. At laſt, they brought to her a ſick child, which, upon her prayers, was reſtored to health. This ſpread her fame abroad, ſo that the Queen of the Country was brought to her, and by her prayers recovered. Whereupon the King, and Kingdom were won over to Chriſt, and the King ſent to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, for ſome to inſtruct them farther in the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Ruffin. Hiſt. Eccl. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 10. The holy Converſation, and the ardent Devotions of private Chriſtians are excellent means to recommend the Goſpel, and to repreſent it, as moſt amiable, and deſireable.</p>
            <p>The other is of <hi>Frumentius &amp; Aedeſius.</hi> Theſe being Chriſtians, were left young in one of the Kingdoms, of the <hi>Inner India,</hi> and were, after ſome time, for their excellent parts, and unſpotted life, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and employed by the Queen of the Country, during the Minority of her Son. In proceſs of time, ſome Roman Merchants came to traffick among them. Then <hi>Frumentius,</hi> underſtanding that there were ſome Chriſtians among them, invited them to reſide with him, and provided a place for them, where they might offer up their prayers to God, after the Chriſtian manner; and himſelf, having obtained leave of the Queen, went to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> requeſting him to ſend ſome Biſhop to that Kingdom to promote the farther entertainment of the Goſpel among them, to which they were well inclined, and diſpoſed for the reception of it. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ordained <hi>Frumentius</hi> himſelf, who returned, and by Gods bleſſing, met with wonderful Succeſs, <hi>Ruffin. Hiſt. Eccl. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>Socrat. Eccl. Hiſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>Sozomen. l.</hi> 2. c. 23. If providence ſhall bring theſe lines to the view of Chriſtian Travellers, Merchants, and Mariners, who come among the poor Heathen, let the examples laid before them, excite, and encourage them to uſe their endeavours to bring them to the knowledge of Chriſt, and the entertainment of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching the caſe of thoſe private Chriſtians, who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, or providentially may come to, or be brought to thoſe places, where the Goſpel is not entertained as yet.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such private Chriſtians as live, in a more ſetled way, among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and other Heathen Nations, and were placed in the third rank, or order, come to have their caſe to be conſidered. How they may be moſt helpful, to promote the entertainment of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>To aſſiſt thoſe whoſe hearts the Lord ſhall bow over to mind this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent work, I ſhall lay before them two Directions. (1.) They muſt carefully avoid all thoſe things, that have a proper tendency to alienate their minds, and affections from the Goſpel, or to exaſperate them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:40119:132"/> it. (2.) They muſt endeavour to uſe ſuch means, and to take ſuch courſes, as have an aptitude to beget in them an eſteem, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Goſpel, and ſo diſpoſe them to embrace it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They who deſign, and endeavour to win upon others, and to diſpoſe them for the Reception of the Goſpel, muſt carefully avoid all ſuch things, as have an aptitude to alienate them from it. I ſhall exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie this Direction in ſome inſtances; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Private Chriſtians muſt prevent, or ſuppreſs all bitter contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among themſelves. It is ſad to obſerve, That differences among Brethren are uſually managed with ſuch mutual accuſations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, as make the name of Chriſtians deſpicable, or odious, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe, who are prejudiced againſt them. Contentions and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities among Chriſtians break out, on two Occaſions. (1.) There may Quarrels ariſe, about Earthly things. What can Heathens think of them, when they ſee them to malign, and worry one another, for ſuch things, as their own Philoſophy hath taught them, to make little account of? <hi>Abraham</hi> was very apprehenſive of the evil conſequences, that might have attended the ſtrife between his, and Lots Herdſmen, probably, about their paſturage, or watering-places, and therefore he would not inſiſt upon ſuch pleas as he might reaſonably have alledged on his own ſide, but ſtifled the contention, and ſought an amicable compoſure, becauſe he dreaded the ſcandal which would have been given to the Heathen, by their brabbles. This is ſuggeſted, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiii. 8, 9. The <hi>Canaanite,</hi> and the <hi>Perizzite</hi> dwelt in the Land. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and wranglings of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> about things that appertain to this life, and their going to Law for them, eſpecially the bringing of their ſuits before Heathen-tribunals, was to caſt reproach on the Chriſtian Religion, as the Apoſtle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 1, 2. How can Chriſtians, without bluſhing, and confuting themſelves, perſwade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, To embrace the Goſpel, which teacheth them to ſet their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things above, and not on things on the Earth. To have their hearts crucified toward the world, and yet, for the ſake thereof to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all the precepts, and to deſpiſe all the Promiſes of the Goſpel? And (like Dogs, that fight about a bone) to tear out one anothers throats, in their rage and fury? we may then conclude, that men, in whom a worldly Spirit is predominant, are very unfit to recommend the Goſpel unto others. (2.) The Croſs-ſentiments which men eſpouſe, and vindicate in things wherein Religion ſeems to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, have beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tten the wideſt breaches, and the moſt furious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions that were ever found among Chriſtians. If we enquire, what ſpark hath kindled this raging fire? We ſhall often find, that this Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt contending is not for that Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints, but a diſpute who ſhall be greateſt; or, it may be, about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is dark, doubtful, or unneceſſary: or about ſome undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Mode. Or, poſſibly, as in ſome great conflagrations, we ſee the fire preys upon, and devours all, and yet we know not, who kindled
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:40119:132"/> it, or how it began. This is, and muſt be for a Lamentation. Once, I am ſure, the diviſions among Chriſtians, and the bitter zeal which manageth their controverſies about Religion, is a mighty impediment, and obſtruction, that ſtops the progreſs of the Goſpel. In the writings of the Ancients we find that the Heathen fortified themſelves in their infidelity, and reſiſted the arguments and perſwaſions of thoſe who recommended the Faith of the Goſpel to them, with this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; Ye Chriſtians are not agreed among your ſelves, ye are broken into many Sects, and Factions, ye confute, and condemn one another; therefore it is more adviſeable for us, to continue as we are, than to leave our preſent ſtation, before we know, where to fix with any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that we are in the Right. All that I am able to do, at preſent, for the removal of this ſcandal, is to beſeech private Chriſtians, in the bowels of Chriſt, To value, love, and follow after the things that make for peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 19. For, I fear, the Goſpel will hardly get ground in the world, until the Spirit of Love, reigning, and acting the hearts of thoſe that profeſs it, do open the way for it. In the firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, the Concord of believers, (<hi>Acts</hi> ii. 42.) did greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its entertainment. It became a Proverbial ſpeech touching Chriſtians, <hi>Ecce quàm ſe diligunt invicem!</hi> Behold, how they love one another. This is a Subject, that cannot be too much inſiſted upon, nor too zealouſly inforced. I account them excellent, and happy perſons indeed, who have a right to bear that Motto, <hi>Beati Pacifici.</hi> This may ſuffice touching the firſt obſtruction, that hinders the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is apparent, that they do not promote, but obſtruct the entertainment of the Goſpel, who would obtrude on thoſe, whom they perſwade to embrace it, ſuch things to be believed, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed (as a part of their Religion) as are no where to be found in it, much more, if they be directly contrary to it. <hi>e. gr.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth expreſly determine, that God only is to be the Object of religious worſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> iv. 10. How then, can they recommend the Goſpel, who tell their Proſelites, that they may admit mere Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be ſharers with God, in that worſhip which is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to him? The Goſpel ſaith, That there is but one Lord, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God, and Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 5. And yet, there are theſe, who pretend to win over men to the Goſpel, who tell them, they muſt conjoin Angels, and departed Saints, with Chriſt in his Office, and Work of Mediator: The Goſpel ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeth all thoſe who believe it, to <hi>flie from Idolatry,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 21. which is the enforcement of the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment [<hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c.] What then, can they whom they are to inſtruct, think of it, when they ſee them, in profound devotion, to creep to, fall down before, and worſhip Images? eſpecially, when, upon that very account, it is notorious, that <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> abhor the Goſpel upon a
<pb facs="tcp:40119:133"/> ſuppoſition, that the worſhip of Images, is either Taught, or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein. If I may have leave to declare my apprehenſions, I muſt ſay, That the Goſpel propounded in its own Native puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſimplicity, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt delivered it, and as they who were divinely inſpired, have recorded it, without any Additional ſupplements, or forreign mixtures, is the moſt effectual way, that God hath appointed, and promiſed to bleſs, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of the world, to Jeſus Chriſt. And I ſhould beſeech thoſe who endeavour the Converſion of Heathens, to preſs nothing upon them (except the preſuppoſed Light, and Law of Nature, right Reaſon, and Diſcipline, to cultivate, civilize, and prepare them) ſave the naked Truths, Ordinances, and Rules, of the Goſpel, in all plainneſs, and ſimplicity. So much for the ſecond Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſymbolize, or comply with thoſe, whom we would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to embrace the Goſpel, in their Superſtitious Cuſtoms, and Obſervances, is not the way, to promote the entertainment of it, but to obſtruct it. Under the name of Cuſtoms, I do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, the uſing of the ſame Diet, or wearing the ſame Stuff, or Faſhion in Apparel: for, poſſibly, the Temperature of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and other conſiderations may make them Neceſſary. Nor, do I mean, meerly Political Cuſtoms, which are ſubſervient to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick order, juſtice, and tranquillity: But I intend Superſtitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and obſervances, wherein ſomewhat of Religion, or ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is placed. There are ſome things, which may paſs in the rank of indifferent, in their own nature; which, yet, become Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, when men place Religion, or Holineſs in them. It is well, known, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote his Book, <hi>De Coronâ militis,</hi> to juſtifie the practice of a Chriſtian Souldier, who refuſed to wear a Crown, or Garland of leaves on his Head, becauſe the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were wont to go ſo adorned, in their Solemnities, and Proceſſions, accounting it a Religious Rite. But, in regard that the Jeſuites, are reported, to practice, and applaud their Method of Compliance with their Converts (as they call them) in <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> and other places; ſo far as to allow them to retain their Pa-gods, and to worſhip them, with ſome Mental reſervations, and the right direction of their Intentions; it will be neceſſary to ſay ſomething more of this, becauſe I have mentioned it as an Obſtruction, that hinders the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Goſpel. I ſhall therefore, briefly, ſet before you, (1.) What we may collect from the Authority of the Scripture; touching the caſe we are upon. (2.) What have been the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome, in after-ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the Scripture hath determined, touching the compliance of the people of God with the ſuperſtitious cuſtoms of the Heathen, whether it be in way of approbation or allowance of them, or of ſymbolizing, and conforming to them, tho under the pretence of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:40119:133"/> taking that courſe, to gain them over to the true Religion, <hi>e. gr.</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that none will deny, That it was the duty of the Jews, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to proſelyte others, to the Faith, and Worſhip of the true God. Let us, then, obſerve, what God did preſcribe, in order thereunto. Did he allow them, to imitate their Rites, or Cuſtoms? No; but quite contrary, He ſeverely chargeth, That, in no wiſe, they ſhould ſymbolize with them, leſt they ſhould be entangled, or corrupted with their manners, <hi>Deut.</hi> xii. 30, 31. Learned men have beſtowed much ſtudy, and diligence, to find out the Reaſons of many Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Preſcriptions, which God appropriated to the Jews. In ſome of them, they have clearly diſcovered a Typical uſe, that they prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſt, or his Church. In others, they find Vertue, and Morality to be inſtilled. In others, Proviſion to be made for Health, Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for ſeveral of them, they have reſolved, that God impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them on purpoſe, to ſet them at a greater diſtance from Idolaters: and to guard them from thoſe evil impreſſions, which the Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arizing of their cuſtoms, might make upon them, as, they might not wear a garment of linnen, and woollen wrought together, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxii. 11. becauſe (as is ſaid) the <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed ſuch. So, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <hi>To round the corners of their head, or, to mar the corners of their beard,</hi> Levit. xix. 27. becauſe Idolaters, and particularly the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were ſo trimmed. It ſeems alſo, that other nations, who offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up their hair to their Demons, out of devotion, were polled after ſome ſuch manner. It is undeniable, as might be argued, from theſe, and ſeveral other reaſons. That it was utterly unlawful for the Jews, to ſymbolize with the heathen; in their Superſtitious Rites. Neither is there a greater latitude for Chriſtians under the Goſpel. They are, certainly, obliged, to flie as far from Idolatry, as the Jews were. Some, indeed, in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> took too great a liberty in their compliances with Idolaters, for they went, with their friends, into the Idols Temple, and feaſted there with them, on the Remainders of the Sacrifices which had been offered to the Idols. And, it is probable, That they pretended, that, by ſuch a condeſcention, in a thing indifferent, they deſigned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their friends affections, the better to recommend the Chriſtian Religion to them. But the Apoſtle doth ſeverely cenſure ſuch Temporizing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 10, 11. with chap. x. 20, 21. Thus, ye have had a ſhort account of the Scripture Authority, reſolving the Caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us, now, hear, what have been the Sentiments of ſome, in after-ages. They were of opinion, That, to adopt ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh obſervances, into the Chriſtian worſhip, was not only war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, but alſo commendable, provided, that care ſhould be firſt taken, to deal with them, as the Jews were to treat thoſe captive heathen-women, whom they intended to marry, and that was, to ſhave their heads, and pair their nails, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxi. 11, 12. Thus they converted many Heatheniſh Rites, into Chriſtian Ceremonies, when
<pb facs="tcp:40119:134"/> they had cleanſed, and varniſhed them, as by changing their Object, End, or Mode. For inſtance; A learned man of our own, hath proved, That the Invocation of departed Saints, was nothing elſe, but the old doctrine of Demons revived. (Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede's</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy of the latter times.) Let not any one ſurmize, That this is an undue Reflection, or a falſe Inſinuation, ſeeing a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Engliſh Prelate hath written, a ſmall Tract, to ſhew, <q>That the Eccleſiaſtical Government obſerved by the Britiſh, and ancient Engliſh Pagans, they being converted unto Chriſtianity, many of the Paganiſh Ceremonies, and Uſages, not contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were ſtill retained in their Chriſtian policy. By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, tranquillity, and peace were preſerved, and the alteration in the ſtate, leſs dangerous, or ſenſible.</q> (Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> his learned Diſcourſe, of Ceremonies retained, and uſed in the Chriſtian Churches.) How far thoſe reaſons did influence ſome, when we departed from Popery, I know not. But I ſuppoſe, ſome things were retained, which ſeem not to have been deſirable upon any other account, than, to make the change leſs ſenſible in its ſelf, and leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the State. As for the Thing it ſelf; For ſome Centuries before the Reformation, there was ſo much borrowed from <hi>Jews,</hi> and Pagans, and lodged in the Church, that, at laſt, the Chriſtian Religion, became much like to that of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xvii. 24. to verſe 35. A compound of the worſhip of the True God, and of Idols blended together. So that the Church of God groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Reformation. Much was done at firſt by our Worthies, poſſibly as much as the Times could then bear. What they could not do, they left to be compleated by their Succeſſors. And, what little reaſon we have now to think to ingratiate our ſelves with the Pagan-Chriſtians (as ſome think they have ground enough to ſtile the Papiſts.) I would rather ye ſhould hear from a learned Doctor, than from me, who delivers this, among his Documents (as he calls them.) <q>Seeing we are ſo well aſſured, that the Papacy is the Kingdom of Antichriſt, or that City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherein the people of God, were held captive, we ſhould leave no ſtring, or taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of our ancient captivity upon us, ſuch, I mean, as whereby they may take hold on us, and pull us back again into our former Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: but look upon our ſelves as abſolutely free from any tie to them, more than in endeavouring their Converſion, and Salvation. Which we knowing ſo experimentally not to be compaſſed by needleſs ſymbolizings with them, in any thing, I conceive our beſt policy, is ſtudiouſly to imitate them in Nothing: But for all indifferent things, to think rather the worſe of them, for their uſing them. As no Perſon of Honour, would willingly go in the known garb of any lewd, and infamous Perſons. Whatſoever we court them in, they do but turn it, to our ſcorn, and contempt, and are the more hardened in their own wickedneſs.</q> [Dr. <hi>Hen. More,</hi> Divine
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40119:134"/> Dialogues, Part ii. <hi>pag.</hi> 398.] How eaſily ſoever Pagan Rites were admitted into the Chriſtian Church, I am ſure many of them have taken ſuch deep root, that it is very difficult to eradicate, and purge them out. So much for the third Obſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They who deſire to be helpful in promoting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Goſpel, muſt not, unneceſſarily provoke, and exaſperate thoſe, whom they would win over to it. <hi>Moſes</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to permit the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to ſacrifice to the Lord, before the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> leſt they ſhould be enraged thereupon, and ſtone them, <hi>Exod.</hi> viii. 25, 26. They muſt not, indeed, forbear to do that, which, under all due circumſtances, God hath made to be their preſent duty. Yet even, in ſuch caſes, they ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Text, <hi>[Walk in wiſdom, toward them that are without.]</hi> And learn what that meaneth, I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice. They muſt declare againſt their idolatry, and endeavour to convert them to the true God, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> xiv. 15. <hi>We preach to you, that ye ſhould turn from theſe vanities unto the living God.</hi> And his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs therein was wonderful, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Act.</hi> xix. 26. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ye ſee, and hear, that not only at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>but almoſt throughout all</hi> Aſia, <hi>this</hi> Paul <hi>hath perſwaded, and turned away much people, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they be no Gods, which are made with hands.</hi> But this muſt not be done with revilings, reproaches, and inſultations: but with judgment, tenderneſs, and meekneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 25, 26. <hi>In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.]</hi> We may conclude then, that it is none of Gods way, (from whomſoever men have learnt it,) to convert Heathens by robbing them of their Goods, and Eſtates, and butchering their Perſons, which was the method that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took to Goſpellize the <hi>Indians,</hi> or to ſend Dragoons as Miſſionaries, to torment thoſe, whom they call Hereticks, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reduce them to their Catholick Church. That's the fourth Obſtruction.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They muſt religiouſly avoid that which is the greateſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all. The profligate, and flagitious lives of ſome that call themſelves Chriſtians. If men were prompted, and employed by the Devil himſelf, they could not take a more effectual courſe, to make the Goſpel to be abhorred, than by living as ſome Chriſtians do. How can it be expected, That the poor, ignorant Heathen, ſhould have any reverence for the great, and Sacred Name of God, when they hear thoſe, who pretend, that they have a deep veneration for him, to Reproach, and Blaſpheme it? They will conclude, That men do but prevaricate, when they tell them, That Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. ii. 14. and yet live ſo, as if Chriſt died, only to procure for them a Licence to continue in ſin, or to purchaſe impunity for them that do ſo. Will they believe thoſe that tell them, Chriſt was made manifeſt, to deſtroy the works of the Devil, and that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:135"/> they act under him as the Captain of their Salvation, while they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their time, parts, and power to eſtabliſh, and defend Satan's Kingdom! Can ye perſwade men, That ye believe there is an Hell, and eternal Flames prepared for the ungodly, and impenitent, and that the wicked ſhall be caſt into it, when they obſerve thoſe that ſay, They believe this, to run poſting, ſporting, and laughing unto it? They will never apprehend, That the Heaven, which they are told the Goſpel promiſeth to the Faithful, and Holy, is any other than a <hi>Poetical Elyſium,</hi> or a <hi>Mahometan Paradiſe,</hi> while they perceive that ſuch as call themſelves Chriſtians, do prefer the world, and ſenſual pleaſures before it. Can any man convince them, That the Saints are ſuch excellent Creatures, when they ſee thoſe who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, to live like Bruits, or Devils? It is a vain attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others, To believe, and obey the Goſpel, until they who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it have learnt better, what it teacheth them, <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 11, 12. To <hi>deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly, in this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the ſtumbling Blocks, which are to be removed out of the way, before any ſucceſsful perſwaſions, Motives, Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or other Means will prevail, to diſpoſe, and incline, thoſe who have not received the Goſpel, to embrace it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But theſe Obſtructions being removed, what ways are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to help on the Entertainment of the Goſpel? To anſwer that Queſtion, I ſhall recommend unto you ſome Few, among many, which, I conceive to be moſt obvious, practicable, and effectual, <hi>e. gr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Private Chriſtians ſhould endeavour to oblige thoſe whom they would perſwade, by Civilities, Kindneſs, and doing good Offices for them, that they may be aſſured, that they love them, and ſeek their real, and eternal good. Our bleſſed Saviour, who beſt underſtood what Attractives were moſt proper, and powerful to draw men to receive Him, and his Goſpel, took this Method, <hi>Act.</hi> x. 38. He <hi>went about Doing good.</hi> He did Good to mens Bodies, that he might do good to their Souls. The Miracles which he wrought, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, of Beneficence, and Obligations, as, To heal the Sick, To give Sight to the Blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's true, He had a ſuperior Aim, and End in working Miracles; which was, To ſhew forth his Glory, to confirm his Doctrine, to ſtrengthen the Faith of his Diſciples, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> ii. 11. and xx. 31. yet ſecondarily, it was, To teſtifie his Kindneſs, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward thoſe, whom he deſigned to perſwade, to believe on him, <hi>Matth.</hi> xv. 32.—<hi>I have compaſſion on the multitude</hi>—and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he wrought a Miracle, for their Refreſhment, <hi>ver.</hi> 36, 37, 38. feeding Four thouſand Men, beſide Women, and Children, with ſeven Loaves, and a few little Fiſhes. And, to this we may add the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 10. <hi>As ye have opportunity, let us do good unto all men; even to ſuch as are not of the houſhold of faith;</hi> i. e. tho they be Infidels. Very pertinent hereto, is that remarkable paſſage in <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:40119:135"/> who acquaints us, That the Chriſtian Religion gained a very high eſteem among the Infidels, upon this occaſion; when Famin, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence raged extremely, in the reign of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> the Chriſtians ſhewed a tender compaſſion to the Pagans, when they were neglected by thoſe of their own Superſtition, for they Buried their Dead: at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and miniſtred unto their Sick: and every day, diſtributed Bread, to thoſe who were ready to periſh; and ſo, by their works, declared themſelves to be the true worſhippers of God, through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccl. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Private Chriſtians muſt be very juſt, and punctual, in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, and Traffick, with thoſe whom they would perſwade, to embrace the Goſpel. They muſt inviolably keep their word, and promiſe with them, and take no advantage of their want of Skill, or Experience, thereby to over-reach, and defraud them. Mr. <hi>Terry,</hi> that was Chaplain to Sir <hi>Thomas Row</hi> (as I remember) Ambaſſador at the Court of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> and hath written of thoſe Countries, hath this paſſage, which cuts to the quick, That when the <hi>Indians</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Commodity in Sale to a Chriſtian, &amp; he bade very diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the price demanded, they would uſually reply, <hi>Do you think that I am a Chriſtian?</hi> intimating thereby, That they made no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Buying, and Selling, but thought all gain lawful, which they ſtuck not to purchaſe, by Flattery, Lying, and Unrighteouſneſs. If then they ſhould meaſure the Rules of the Goſpel by the Practice of ſuch as Profeſs it (which is very ordinary) they would deſpiſe it, as falling ſhort of their own Philoſophy, or Morality, which were greatly refined about Matters of common Right, and Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Private Chriſtians ſhould abound in the exerciſe of thoſe amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Graces, the Evidences, and Effects whereof fall under the notice, and obſervation of Others. Such as are mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 22. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance.</hi> They who are Strangers to the Goſpel, underſtand not the ſublime Myſteries of Faith: But they can judge of things, that fall under the perception of Senſe, and Reaſon. They underſtand not what a man's notions may be in Speculation; But they can tell, when a man is juſt, ſober, humble, courteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when thoſe excellent Qualities do ſhew themſelves, they may be brought, to enquire into, and to admire thoſe hidden Cauſes, that produce ſuch rare, and deſirable Effects.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Private Chriſtians ſhould labour, to maintain, and diſcover an even, and undiſturbed frame of Spirit, under various revolutions of Providence: neither over-joying their Comforts, nor Over-grieving their Croſſes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 29, 30, 31. <hi>But this I ſay, Brethren, the time is ſhort. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none: And they that weep as though they wept not, and they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, as though they rejoiced not: and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not: And they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it.</hi>—What a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb facs="tcp:40119:136"/> Argument muſt this needs be, to one who is acted by no higher a Principle, than Fleſh, or Nature, to behold a Chriſtian, to live above the Gaieties of the world, as having more pure, ſpiritual, and heavenly Enjoyments to entertain his Soul withal? And to obſerve, That Croſſes, and Afflictions, do not abate his Love to God, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, which he hath for God, or his Joy in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Private Chriſtians ſhould make themſelves remarkable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the faithful diſcharge of Relative Duties. With theſe, they are frequently, and earneſtly charged; and that upon this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account, becauſe the Honour, and Intereſt of the Goſpel, is ſo much concerned in them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 1. <hi>Let as many Servants as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke, count their own Maſters worthy of all honour, that the name of God, and his doctrin be not blaſphemed.</hi> It is evident, that Heathen-Morality was greatly defective, in the regulating of Domeſtick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore, the Rules, and Directions given in the Goſpel concerning them, muſt highly advance it, in the eſteem, and judgment of all conſidering perſons.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Private Chriſtians ſhould order the whole courſe of their lives and converſations, ſo <hi>as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. i. 27. that thereby, <hi>they may adorn the Doctrine of God, and our Saviour, in all things, Tit.</hi> ii. 10. when men ſee ſuch glorious rays of Holineſs ſparkling, and ſhining in the whole tenour of a Chriſtian's converſation, they muſt needs be convinced, That the Goſpel doth furniſh them with thoſe Principles of Light, and Grace, that infinitely tranſcend thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and broken notices of Good, and Evil, that are found in Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but Unrenewed Nature.</p>
            <p>Theſe Inſtances, among ſeveral others, that might be mentioned, may direct private Chriſtians, How they may be helpful to promote the Entertainment of the Goſpel. Which was the Enquiry, at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>Application. And now, After that all this hath been ſpoken, It is likely, That ſome Private Chriſtians, who mean well, may think this whole Diſcourſe very remote from their concernments, and that it tends but little to their Edification, and thereupon infer, That the Subject was ill choſen; and that ſomething more profitable might have been pitcht upon. But I would entreat thoſe, who have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any ſuch prejudices, before they paſs their cenſure, maturely to conſider, what it is, that hath been inſiſted upon, and then I hope, that they who are ſincerely Godly, and Prudent, will not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unconcerned, in that which ſo nearly relates to the Glory of God; the Sanctifying of his Name, and the enlargement and Proſperity of the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Such prejudices being removed, There are two things, that I would earneſtly recommend to godly private Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Charge your Conſciences with this, as a neceſſary, excellent, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and comfortable Duty, That ye ſtand obliged, in all ways
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40119:136"/> preſcribed by God, according to your circumſtances, to be helpful toward the promoting of the entertainment of the Goſpel. Look upon your former failings, as ſinful, and to be repented of: and, for the future, apply your ſelves more vigorouſly, and chearfully to this bleſſed work. To move, and encourage you hereunto,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Excite your Faith to receive, and reallize thoſe many glorious Promiſes, which are made to Chriſt, as Mediator, touching the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and Enlargement of his Kingdom in the world; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> ii. 8. <hi>Ask of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth, for thy poſſeſſion;</hi> with abundance more of the ſame import.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that the Preaching of the Goſpel is the ordinary means, whereby ſubjects are gained to Chriſt, and brought under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rom.</hi> x. 14, 15, 17. If ye then promote the ſpreading of the Goſpel, ye enlarge the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tenderly pity, and compaſſionate the many Millions of the Sons, and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> who were hewn out of the ſame Rock, and dig'd out of the ſame hole of the Pit with your ſelves, who, as yet, lye in thraldom under Satan, and are Members of his viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: It would, doubtleſs, be very grateful to you, if your aſſiſtance might contribute any thing toward their deliverance out of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable bondage: and the means to procure it, is to help on, as far as ye may, the bringing of the Goſpel among them; for that is God's appointed way to effect it, <hi>Luk.</hi> iv. 18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor, he hath ſent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives</hi>— Acts xxvi. 17, 18.—<hi>and from the Gentiles, to whom I now ſend thee, To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of Sins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified</hi>—</p>
            <p n="4">4. Remember, That Grace, when it hath its freedom of exerciſe, will draw you off, from centering in Self, and raiſe in you a ſpirit of freedom, and nobleneſs to ſeek the good of others, eſpecially to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory of God, in the Salvation of Souls. Take heed, that ye be not found in the number of thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 21. <hi>For all ſeek their own, not the things, which are Jeſus Chriſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. I hope ye do not deſire to be excuſed, or excluded, from bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part, in that honourable and glorious work, of being employed by Chriſt, (in your Stations, and according to your Capacities) in the affairs of his Kingdom: but that it would grieve you at the very heart, to be laid aſide, as a deſpiſed, broken Idol; when all this is recollected, and maturely pondered, where is that godly private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that will deliberately ſay, I am not concerned, to be helpful, in ſuch ways as are proper for me, in promoting the Entertainment of the Goſpel?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:137"/>
            <p>Secondly, As for thoſe godly private Chriſtians, whoſe hearts are ſincerely willing to be ſerviceable to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and would exceedingly rejoyce to contribute all the aſſiſtance, that they are able to afford, for the Converſion, and Salvation of periſhing Souls; but complain, That the work in which this Diſcourſe would engage them, lies a great way off, and is out of their reach. But could they be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about any thing of that nature, within the compaſs of their ſphere of activity, they would moſt gladly embrace it, and vigorouſly beſtir themſelves in it. If that be, really, the Caſe of any, Then, I ſay to ſuch, Up, and be doing, and the Lord be with you, to direct, help, and ſucceed you; for ye will find enough to do at your own doors, and, probably, in your own Houſes. Briefly and plainly then, the matter ſtands thus: There are many, who have entertained the Goſpel, as far as a general, ignorant, cuſtomary Profeſſion will go: but are ſo far from admitting the ſpirit, life, and power of it, into their hearts, that they are not only utter ſtrangers to it, but are full of bitter enmity againſt it. Will ye be helpful, now, to prevail with them to receive it, with Faith, Love, and Obedience? It will be as acceptable (and, I fear, ye will find it as difficult) a work to bring a wicked, hard-hearted Chriſtian, to believe in Chriſt, to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul, as an open Infidel to make profeſſion of the Goſpel. Ye will find many as ignorant of the very Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, as the very Pagans; as froward, perverſe, and oppoſite to all means of Inſtruction, as Indians; many that love their Luſts, and hold them as faſt, as any in the world. The Barbarians are prejudiced againſt our Religion, becauſe they underſtand it not, or have had it miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them: but the more plainly, and truly, it is ſet forth before prophane ones, at home, the more bitterly do they hate it, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the greater averſation to it. So ye ſee, That tho' the Scene of the Queſtion ſeemed to be laid afar off, yet the purport, and deſign of it reacheth us at home. And I believe, No godly private Chriſtian will ſay, that he is not concerned to ſeek the Converſion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ignorant, ſenſual, prophane, and ungodly ones, among whom they live. If ye ask me then, How may we be helpful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? I anſwer, That generally, the ſame Methods are to be made uſe of, that have already been inſiſted upon. As, To endeavour, in our ſeveral Stations and Capacities, That ſuch may be employed, and encouraged to Preach the Goſpel, as are themſelves ſeaſoned with the Spirit, and grace of it, and zealouſly ſeek the Converſion, and Salvation of Souls. To Pray more fervently for the pouring out of the Spirit, to make the Preaching of the Word ſucceſsful. To remove all Impediments and Obſtructions, as far as we can, out of their way. To aſſiſt them with what help we can, by obliging, inſtructing, and perſwading, and walking exemplarily before them. But I ſhall not proceed farther in this, becauſe it would draw out the Diſcourſe to too great a length: and I think it would be for your Edification, to review
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40119:137"/> over again, what hath been already inſiſted upon, and then, upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, ye may diſcover more, than fell under your notice, in the firſt curſory reading. I ſhall conclude all with <hi>Jam.</hi> v. 19, 20. <hi>Brethren, If any of you do err from the faith, and one convert him, Let him know, that he which converteth the Sinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and hide a multitude of ſins.</hi>

            <p>In this Chapter, where my Text lies, He admoniſhes them to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſhly luſts which war againſt the ſoul:</hi> he exhorts them to a converſation, that would glorifie God, convince the World, and adorn the Goſpel: their <hi>Zeal</hi> ought to be ſo great of thoſe <hi>works that are good;</hi> that they ſhould not think much to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for well doing. <hi>Bona agere, &amp; mala pati;</hi> to do good, and to hold on in ſo doing, though very ill requited for it; this is high and noble indeed; this is an <hi>honour</hi> not vouchſafed to the <hi>elect Angels;</hi> who are not capable

            </p>
            <p>In the words which I have read, you may take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>one end</hi> of Chriſt in Suffering; and that is, that <hi>he might leave us an example.</hi> To ſay that this was the <hi>principal end</hi> of his paſſion; to deny his ſatisfaction, as if it were impoſſible or needleſs; is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical in a very high degree; to deny the Blood of Chriſt to be the <hi>price of our redemption,</hi> is to <hi>deny the Lord that bought us:</hi> And truly the only propitiatory Sacrifice for Sin being rejected; there is no other remaining; but <hi>a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and of fiery indignation which ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</hi> And yet though Chriſt <hi>bare our ſins in his own body on the tree;</hi> He is not only our Redeemer, but our Example. He hath bequeathed Bleſſings never enough to be valued, in his Teſtament: he has alſo left us an incomparable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>Example,</hi> is either taken from excellent <hi>Writing-Masters,</hi> who ſet a <hi>fair Copy</hi> for their Scholars to write after; or 'tis taken from <hi>Painters,</hi> who draw a <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Maſterpiece,</hi> for inferiour Artiſts their Admiration and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were remarkable <hi>ſteps</hi> that Chriſt took when he was here in the <hi>days of his fleſh:</hi> and among them all he did not take <hi>one wrong one.</hi> He was <hi>made of a Woman, made under the Law;</hi> and he did not in the leaſt tranſgreſs the Law. He came upon this Earth to do his Father's Will; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Lo, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.</hi> And never did he any thing that was in any degree contrary to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Steps of Chriſt are to <hi>be followed.</hi> Good men in Scripture are our patterns, whoſe Faith and Patience we are to follow, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>That ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promiſe.</hi> The <hi>Cloud of witneſſes</hi> is to be minded, and the <hi>bright ſide</hi> of it gives a good light unto our feet: but there is a <hi>dark ſide</hi> of the Cloud which may make us cautious: we muſt take heed of reſembling the beſt of Men in that which is bad, in their falls and infirmities. <hi>Abraham</hi> is renowned for his <hi>faith;</hi> yet not to be imitated, in the <hi>carnal ſhifts</hi> he made for the ſaving of his life. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> was to be blamed, for being <hi>carried away</hi> by <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But Chriſt is ſuch an example; as to walk according to it; and to walk by the ſtricteſt rule is all one: for our Lord did whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever became him; and exactly <hi>fulfill'd all righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Here is a <hi>ſpecial intimation,</hi> (as appears by the context) of a Chriſtian's Duty <hi>patiently to bear injuries, and to take up the croſs.</hi> Though the Goſpel be the gladdeſt tidings, yet <hi>Suffering</hi> is a word that ſounds very <hi>harſh</hi> to fleſh and blood. But the Apoſtle bids us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt in his Sufferings, and not think m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40119:138"/> were but a <hi>drop,</hi> compared with <hi>His,</hi> which were a <hi>vaſt Ocean.</hi> The Sufferings of Chriſt the Head, were unconceivably greater, than thoſe which any of his Members at any time are called to undergo. And indeed when he <hi>drank the Cup his Father gave him:</hi> he drank out the <hi>Curſe</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs</hi> of it; ſo that it is both <hi>bleſs't</hi> and <hi>ſweetned</hi> to the Lambs followers who are to drink after him.</p>

The Sufferings of Chriſt and his Example, being joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Text: here is a ſignification, that by his Death he has <hi>purchaſed Grace</hi> to <hi>aſſist and enable us</hi> to follow his example. Our Lord knows our natural impotency; nay, averſeneſs to <hi>follow him,</hi> or ſo much as to <hi>look to him.</hi> His death is effectual therefore to kill our Sin; and to heal our depraved Nature: his <hi>power reſts upon us</hi> that we may tread the Path in which he is gone before us. <hi>I am able to do all things,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthning me.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place I am to premiſe ſome things by way of <hi>Caution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Think not as long as you remain in this world, <hi>to be altogether free from Sin as Chriſt was.</hi> He indeed was from his <hi>Conception</hi> in the Womb, to his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> far above all viſible Heavens, altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate and <hi>without blemiſh.</hi> Some have fancied ſpots in the Sun; but ſure I am, in the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> there is none. The Sins of all that are ſaved were <hi>laid upon him:</hi> but no Sin was ever <hi>found in him,</hi> or <hi>done by him.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that he was <hi>holy, harmleſs and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,</hi> Heb. 7.26. You are indeed to imitate Chriſt in Purity; but perfect Holineſs you cannot attain to; while you carry ſuch a body of Death about you, and are in ſuch a world as this. It may comfort you, to conſider; after the <hi>fall</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> and the ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it; how the <hi>ſecond Adam ſtood</hi> and conquer'd, and kept himſelf unſpotted from the world, all the while he converſed in it; But as long as you remain on Earth, <hi>ſome defilement</hi> will cleave to you;
<pb facs="tcp:40119:139"/> to admoniſh you <hi>where you are;</hi> and to make you <hi>long</hi> for the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem.</hi> More and more holy you may; and ought to be; but to be <hi>compleatly holy;</hi> is the happineſs not of <hi>Earth,</hi> but <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Think not that Chriſt in <hi>all his actions is to be imitated.</hi> There are Royalties belonging to our Lord Jeſus which none muſt invade. He alone is <hi>Judg and Lawgiver</hi> in <hi>Zion:</hi> and that <hi>worſhip is vain</hi> which is taught by the <hi>Precepts of Men.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>all in all,</hi> he <hi>fills all in all,</hi> Eph. 1.23. When the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the laſt <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> told <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, <hi>That all Power was given to him in Heaven and Earth:</hi> As it was <hi>blaſphemous flattery</hi> in them to <hi>give;</hi> ſo it was <hi>blaſphemous pride</hi> and right <hi>Antichristian arrogancy</hi> in Him to <hi>accept</hi> the honour. When our Lord was upon Earth; there were ſeveral acts of Power which he exerted, as, <hi>giving ſight</hi> to the blind, <hi>raiſing the dead,</hi> and ſuch like; which Chriſtians <hi>now</hi> muſt not think of doing.<note place="margin">Elegit Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los humiliter natos, inhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratos, illitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </note> I grant that the power of working Miracles was communicated to the Apoſtles and others; but it was <hi>Res unius aetatis,</hi> a thing that laſted little longer than <hi>One age.</hi> Theſe Miracles were neceſſary when the Goſpel was firſt to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world; but now they are ceaſed: and if there were but a general exactneſs and exemplarineſs, in Chriſtians lives and practiſes; this might be <hi>majus omni miraculo,</hi> a great deal more than Miracles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Goſpels Propagation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Think not that <hi>your obedience can be meritorious,</hi> as was the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our Lord and Saviour. The Apoſtle tells us; that <hi>by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of One,</hi> i. e. the ſecond <hi>Adam; many are made righteous;</hi> and to this obedience is owing, that <hi>abundance of grace</hi> which believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; the <hi>gift of righteouſneſs;</hi> and alſo <hi>reigning in life eternal,</hi> Rom. 5.17.19. The Merit of our Lord Jeſus is ſo every way ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; that Believers Merit is as needleſs; as all things conſider'd, 'tis impoſſible. It was very Orthodox Humility in <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he confeſſed <hi>he was leſs than the leaſt of all mercies.</hi> And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> though he ſpeaks again and again of the <hi>good deeds</hi> he had done: was certainly very far from the opinion of Merit. As appears, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, O my God, concerning this alſo; and ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. You muſt not imagine that <hi>your greateſt ſufferings for the ſake of righteouſneſs; are in the leaſt expiatory of ſin;</hi> as Chriſt's Sufferings were. Chriſt was <hi>deliver'd for our offences,</hi> and by <hi>one offering he has perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. the offering was but <hi>one;</hi> the Sacrifice of himſelf: and it was offer'd but <hi>once: other</hi> Sacrifices are unneceſſary; 'tis unneceſſary that <hi>this</hi> ſhould be <hi>again</hi> offer'd. Our Lord upon the Croſs with his <hi>laſt breath,</hi> cryed out, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> Joh. 19.30. <hi>q. d.</hi> All is done, all is undergone that was needful for my Churches acceptation with God; and the full remiſſion of all their Treſpaſſes. Underſtand; that no Sufferings, that you can undergo for Chriſt's ſake, are ſatisfactory for your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: do not by ſuch a thought offer to derogate from Chriſt's
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40119:139"/> compleat ſatisfaction. We read of ſome that <hi>came out of great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation;</hi> but did the blood of theſe Martyrs juſtifie them? no ſuch matter; <hi>they waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7.14.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, I am to ſhew you in what reſpects <hi>Chriſt is an Example</hi> to be followed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt is to be followed in <hi>his great Self-denial.</hi> It had been a <hi>great Stoop</hi> in the Son of God; if his Deity had been veiled with the <hi>Nature of Angels:</hi> a greater Stoop, it would have been to be made Fleſh; though he had been born of an Empreſs; and had been as glorious a Temporal Monarch, as the Jews fancied he would be. But this is exceedingly amazing to behold Him, that <hi>thought it no robbery to be equal with God, making himſelf of no reputation, and taking upon him the form of a Servant,</hi> Phil. 2.7. He did not abhor a <hi>poor Virgins Womb;</hi> nor afterwards to be laid in a <hi>Manger.</hi> And though he was Lord of all, yet for <hi>our ſakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich;</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. thus he <hi>pleaſed not himſelf.</hi> Rom. 15.3. neither did he ſeek himſelf and his own honour, but <hi>the honour and glory of him that ſent him.</hi> Joh. 7.18.</p>
            <p>How can he be a follower of Chriſt who is ſo utterly unlike him in being ſelfiſh? Our Lord knew the prevalency of ſelf-love; and how oppoſite 'tis to the love of God, and care of the Soul: therefore he ſtrictly requires <hi>Self-denial.</hi> Luk. 9.23. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſeipſum abdicet,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it. Self-abdication is called for; a man muſt have no regard to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to his own ends and inclinations; as they are oppoſite unto, and lead him away from God, and from his Duty. Oh, act as <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and as thoſe that are <hi>not your former ſelves!</hi> ſeek not <hi>your own things.</hi> Let nothing be done through <hi>vain glory;</hi> be ever diffident, and jealous of your ſelves. Self is the Enemy that is <hi>always preſent;</hi> and <hi>moſt within us,</hi> and that has the greateſt power to ſway us: We are <hi>not our own, we are bought with a price;</hi> we <hi>ſhould glorifie</hi> the Lord that has bought us, as thoſe that are <hi>Debtors,</hi> not <hi>to</hi> our ſelves, but <hi>of</hi> our ſelves to Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is to be followed in his <hi>Patient enduring the worlds hatred; and the ſlights and contradiction of ſinners.</hi> It was the Fathers and the Sons love to the world, that brought Chriſt into it: and he came <hi>not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 3.17. Yet what ſtrange kind of uſage from the world did he meet with! The world was mad upon Sin, venturous upon Hell and wrath: and with contempt and hatred rejected the only Saviour. His Perſon they are prejudiced againſt; his Doctrine they contradict; and his <hi>Deſign</hi> they oppoſe, though <hi>their</hi> Deliverance and Salvation was <hi>deſigned.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:140"/>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould not think it ſtrange; that they meet with hard and unworthy uſage from the world. <hi>Cain</hi> did quickly ſhew his enmity againſt <hi>Abel</hi> his Brother, <hi>becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.12. <hi>If the world hate you,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ye know it hated me before it hated you; if ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you,</hi> Joh. 15.18, 19. Now as Chriſt was <hi>unmoved</hi> by the worlds Malice either from <hi>doing his work,</hi> or from <hi>looking to the joy that was ſet before him;</hi> ſo ſhould Chriſtians alſo be. Conquer the world by contempt of its fury; overcome its evil with good: and as Chriſt made <hi>interceſſion for the tranſgreſſours,</hi> that cryed, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him;</hi> ſo do ye <hi>love your Enemies; bleſs them that curſe you; do good to them that hate you; pray for them that deſpightfully uſe you, and perſecute you,</hi> Mat. 5.44.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt is to be followed in <hi>his reſiſting and overcoming the Prince of darkneſs.</hi> Satan aſſaulted the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> and was too hard for him. He was ſo bold, as to ſet upon the <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> but was foil'd by the <hi>Captain of our Salvation.</hi> If you read the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. you may perceive that <hi>nothing</hi> from the tempter <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens</hi> upon our Lord Jeſus. The ſubtlety of the old Serpent was in vain; and by the Sword of the Spirit, all his force was repelled.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians are to look upon the Evil one; as an Enemy that Chriſt has conquer'd, and this ſhould encourage them in their conflicts with him: they are to deſpiſe his offers; they are not to be perſwaded by his miſapplication of Scripture to any thing that is unjuſtifiable, and irregular. The <hi>Word of God ſhould abide in them; that they may be ſtrong; and overcome the wicked one,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.14. The Head always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; ſhall the Members yield to this Deſtroyer? Let not your hearts be <hi>filled with Satan;</hi> let not your heads and hands be employed by him; <hi>who works in the Children of diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Chriſt is to be followed <hi>in his contempt of the worlds glory, and contentment with a mean and low eſtate in it.</hi> Never was the world <hi>ſo ſet forth,</hi> in ſuch an <hi>alluring dreſs;</hi> as when <hi>the God of it</hi> in a moment of time, ſhew'd unto our Lord Jeſus <hi>all the Kingdoms of the world, and all the glory of them,</hi> Luk. 4.5. yet the heavenly Mind of Chriſt is not taken with the ſight; he knew he ſaw nothing but what was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and his <hi>Kingdom which was not of this world,</hi> was a far better thing, than the worlds beſt Kingdom. Inſtead of purſuing, he flees from a Crown; which the people were ready to force upon his head.</p>
            <p>Ambition and covetouſneſs after worldly grandeur and gain; which make us ſo unlike to Chriſt; ſhould be far from us. If the world be the great thing with us; <hi>Mammon</hi> will have us at command; and Chriſt will have but little ſervice from us. Why ſhould that be high in the eſteem and affection of your hearts, which Chriſt ſo little minded? <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. <hi>Set your affection on things above, not on things that are
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:40119:140"/> on earth,</hi> Col. 3.2. If you have the worlds riches, let not your <hi>minds be high,</hi> nor your <hi>hearts ſet upon them;</hi> and be <hi>rich in good works;</hi> if you are in a meaner eſtate, be ſatisfied; remember who ſaid, <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> The beſt men in the world; that have done moſt good in the world, have leaſt cared for the world; and have been moſt willing to leave the world; and go to a better.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Chriſt is to be followed in <hi>his living a life ſo very beneficial; doing good being his perpetual buſineſs.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who was one of his greateſt and moſt conſtant attendants, ſays, that <hi>he went about doing good,</hi> Act. 10.38. to do thus <hi>was meat and drink to him.</hi> How great was his Kindneſs and Compaſſion to Souls; how much Mercy does he ſhew to the Bodies of Men!</p>
            <p>You that are Chriſtians, be very active in the beſt ſence; the true Members of Chriſt have the Spirit of the Head in them, whoſe <hi>fruit is in all goodneſs, and righteouſneſs, and truth,</hi> Eph. 5.9. What have you Faith for, but that <hi>it may work by Love?</hi> Why are you <hi>created in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> but that you may be employed <hi>in good works, which God hath before ordained, that you ſhould walk in them?</hi> Eph. 2.10. Be ſure to <hi>do juſtly;</hi> be injurious to none; render unto all their dues: and do not only conſult the <hi>dues</hi> of others; but their <hi>needs</hi> alſo; and <hi>love to be merciful;</hi> and let the <hi>periſhing Souls,</hi> as well as the diſtreſſed Bodies of others; have a great ſhare in your Compaſſions. As you <hi>have opportunity do good unto all men;</hi> and good of as <hi>many ſorts,</hi> as may be; <hi>eſpecially to the houſhold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6.10. The Apoſtle ſpeaks with great authority and aſſeveration, when he preſſes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian practice. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying; and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly; that they who have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good works; theſe things are good and profitable unto men,</hi> Tit. 3.8. A Chriſtian by Profeſſion, who lives wickedly, is not a <hi>true Member;</hi> but a <hi>Monſter</hi> in the Church; and will not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured long, but is near to be cut off and deſtroy'd. It's a true Saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Death does not deſtroy the Soul; but 'tis an ill Life that ruins it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Chriſt is to be followed in <hi>his moſt profitable and edifying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> We read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. That <hi>grace was poured into his Lips:</hi> the <hi>gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> were the <hi>wonder</hi> of the hearers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.22. Exact <hi>truth</hi> always accompanied his Speeches: he never ſpake a word that was <hi>offenſive to God,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to any man.</hi> Was he chargeable with <hi>guile?</hi> or <hi>when he was reviled did he revile again?</hi> No, no; he gave a better example: he ſpeaks words to awaken Sinners; to ſearch Hypocrites; and how does he comfort the mourners; calling <hi>all the weary and heavy laden to come to him for reſt?</hi> He takes occaſion almoſt from every thing; to diſcourſe of the heavenly kingdom. His parables of the <hi>ſower,</hi> of <hi>leaven,</hi> of the <hi>Merchant man ſeeking goodly pearls,</hi> and ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:40119:141"/> like; plainly ſhew that the moſt <hi>ordinary things</hi> may <hi>ſpiritually be improved</hi> unto great uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>All Profeſſours! and eſpecially <hi>you</hi> of <hi>London!</hi> ſet a watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door of your lips; and let your words be like the words of Chriſt Jeſus. Your lying and corrupt communication; your ſlanderous and backbiting words; your paſſionate and angry ſpeeches and revilings; are theſe like <hi>Chriſts language?</hi> An <hi>unbridled tongue,</hi> though it utters many a falſhood; yet it ſpeaks one certain truth, that your <hi>Religion is but vain, Jam.</hi> 1.26. Let Conſcience be tender; and purpoſe with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that your mouths ſhall not tranſgreſs.</hi> Let the word of Chriſt be more in your Hearts; for out of the abundance of the Heart the mouth ſpeaks. <hi>Let your ſpeech be always with Grace,</hi> Col 4.6. Diſcourſe as thoſe who do believe, you are <hi>debtors</hi> of edifying words one to another; that idle words are heard by him that is in Heaven; and an <hi>account muſt be given of them in the day of judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Chriſt is to be followed <hi>in his manner of performing holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> never was He negligent in an Ordinance. <hi>His cries were ſtrong, his tears many,</hi> Heb 5.7. and how does he wreſtle with his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father!</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould take heed of doing the work of God <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>fervent in Spirit when ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12.11. Look to your <hi>Hearts</hi> in all your performances, for Gods eye is fixed upon them: and if they are not preſent and right with him; your duties are but dead duties; and dead duties are really dead works: ſo far from being acceptable; that they are an abomination. When Chriſt was here upon the Earth, as he taught in <hi>other places,</hi> ſo he went to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to the <hi>Synagogues;</hi> though there was much <hi>corruption in the Jewiſh Church.</hi> Chriſtians ſhould learn ſo much <hi>moderation,</hi> as to own what is <hi>good</hi> even in them in whom there are <hi>mixtures</hi> of much that is <hi>bad,</hi> and there ſhould be a cauſe that will paſs for juſt and ſufficient at the great day; before they reſolve upon a <hi>total ſeparation</hi> from their Brethren.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Chriſt is to be followed in <hi>his great humility and meekneſs,</hi> Mat. 11.29. <hi>Take my yoak upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls.</hi> Pride over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>firſt man;</hi> he affected Divinity, and would needs be <hi>as God:</hi> but behold the Lord Jeſus, who is the Eternal God, and he humbled himſelf and <hi>became Man.</hi> Humility was the conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ornament of the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Though this great Redeemer be the <hi>chief of all the ways of God;</hi> though <hi>more</hi> of God is <hi>viſible in Him</hi> than in the <hi>whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſides:</hi> Though he <hi>glorifies</hi> his Father <hi>more</hi> than <hi>all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in Heaven and Earth put together: and though <hi>he is exalted far above all Principalities and Powers, and Might and Dominion, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="318" facs="tcp:40119:141"/>
            <p>Humility is one moſt remarkable feature in the image of Chriſt; therefore reſemble him in being humble. Be not proud of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, Hair, and Ornaments,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. <gap reason="foreign">

Riches are not always <hi>to men of understanding;</hi> and there may be a great deal of Gold in the Purſe, where there is no true Wiſdom in the Head, no Grace at all in the Heart: Let not your <hi>natural parts;</hi> your <hi>acquired endowments;</hi> your <hi>ſpiritual Gifts,</hi> though never ſo <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent;</hi> make you to look upon <hi>others</hi> with <hi>contempt;</hi> upon <hi>your ſelves</hi> with <hi>admiration:</hi> you owe all Glory to that God from whom you have received all. Let Humility look out at your Eyes; a <hi>proud look is</hi> one of the <hi>ſeven things which the Lord hates,</hi> Prov. 6.16, 17. Let Humility <hi>expreſs</hi> it ſelf at your <hi>Lips;</hi> let it attend you in all your <hi>addreſſes to God,</hi> and beautifie your whole <hi>behaviour, and converſes</hi> with Men. The more humble you are, the more of <hi>every other Grace</hi> will be imparted to you; the more <hi>Reſt and Peace</hi> you will have <hi>within your ſelves;</hi> and ſince <hi>you will be ready</hi> to give <hi>him</hi> all the Praiſe; the <hi>Lord is ready</hi> to put the <hi>more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon you</hi> in making you <hi>uſeful unto others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Chriſt is to be followed in <hi>his love to God; great care to pleaſe him; and fervent zeal for his Name and Glory,</hi> Joh. 14.31. <hi>The World may know, ſays Chriſt, that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me Commandment even ſo I do.</hi> He obeyed <hi>that firſt and great Commandment,</hi> and <hi>loved the Lord his God, with all his Heart, and Soul, and Mind, and Strength.</hi> Chriſts love made him do whatever his Father pleaſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.29. <hi>He that ſent me is with me; the Father hath not left me alone, for I always do thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> Chriſts love was ſtronger than Death; no <hi>Waters, no Flouds,</hi> could drown it; neither could the <hi>Baptiſm of blood quench it.</hi> Chriſt was <hi>conſumed</hi> with Divine and Holy <hi>zeal;</hi> and he matters not what befal him; ſo he might but <hi>glorifie his Father;</hi> and <hi>finiſh the work which was given him to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh let us bring our <hi>cold and careleſs Hearts</hi> hither; to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this <hi>Great Example;</hi> that the <hi>froſt may melt;</hi> care may be <hi>awakened;</hi> and there may be ſomething in us, that may deſerve the name of <hi>Warm zeal for God.</hi> Let us be importunate in Prayer, and reſtleſs, till we feel the conſtraints of the Love of God force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; till we find really the greateſt delight and pleaſure in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which pleaſes him; and, aiming at his Glory; we think not much of labour, difficulty, and hazzard; that this our end may be attained.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Chriſt is to be followed <hi>in his Sufferings and Death;</hi> and unto this my Text has a more particular reference. Chriſts <hi>Faith
<pb facs="tcp:40119:142"/> was ſtrong;</hi> though he was under a <hi>diſmal Deſertion.</hi> The <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> did <hi>ſet</hi> in a <hi>dark cloud.</hi> He ſubmitted to his Fathers will; and being confident of a joyful Reſurrection, he <hi>endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Chriſtians come to <hi>die,</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould be moſt <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> as being near <hi>finiſhing;</hi> it ſhould by no means fail when there is moſt need of it. <hi>Though he ſlay me,</hi> ſays <hi>Job, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> Job 13.15.

            <p>In the third place, I am to produce ſome <hi>Arguments</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to the <hi>imitation of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider the <hi>greatneſs of the Perſon</hi> that gives you the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Chriſt has this <hi>Name written on his Veſture, and on his Thigh; <hi>King of Kings,</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> Rev. 19.16. A Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian commends a Prince who is <hi>maximus imperio,</hi>

               <hi>exemplo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> greateſt in authority, and yet greater by his example. <hi>Every thing in Heaven, and Earth, and</hi> under <hi>the Earth does bow,</hi> and is ſubject to the Lord Jeſus, and yet whoſe obedience ever was ſo exact as his was? He gives us precepts, and he himſelf is the great Pattern of performance. <hi>Claudian</hi> the Poet has a notable paſſage concerning the examples of Monarchs; and what a mighty influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they have:
<q>
                  <l>— Tunc obſervantior aequi</l>
                  <l>Fit populus; nec ferre vetat, cum viderit ipſum</l>
                  <l>Autorein, parere ſibi; componitur Orbis</l>
                  <l>Regis ad exemplum; nec ſic inflectere ſenſus</l>
                  <l>Humanos edicta valent; quàm vita Regentis.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Kings have <hi>many obſervers,</hi> who very much Eye them, and their high eſtate both <hi>awes</hi> and <hi>allures</hi> their Subjects to the imitation of them. If <hi>they</hi> keep within the <hi>bounds</hi> of their <hi>own Laws,</hi> their Subjects will be the more unwilling to tranſgreſs them. Chriſt is the <hi>univerſal Soveraign</hi> who commands both Heaven and Earth; and has the whole Creation at his beck. He has kept the Laws, he gives his Church; 'tis duty, 'tis intereſt, 'tis reaſonable, 'tis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to reſemble him in obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:40119:142"/>2. Remember <hi>the Relation, wherein you that are Saints do ſtand, unto the Lord Jeſus.</hi> You are <hi>eſpouſed</hi> to Him; and ſhould you not conſent to be like to him, who has <hi>betrothed you unto himſelf in Loving-kindneſs, Mercy and Faithfulneſs for ever?</hi> Hoſ. 2.19, 20. Nay you are <hi>members of his body.</hi> Therefore you ſhould <hi>grow up into Him in all things which is the Head, even Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.15. You ſhould diſcover ſuch a mind as Chriſt had; you ſhould manifeſt the ſame Spirit; and act as he acted when he was here in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, that God <hi>did fore-ordain you that are Believers to a conformity to the Lord Jeſus;</hi> Rom. 8.29. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the first-born among many Brethren.</hi> If you would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with Chriſt in Glory, you muſt be now changed into his Image; <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>patient ſuffering</hi> will make you like him, and is the <hi>decreed way</hi> unto his Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Walking <hi>as Christ walked will make it evident that you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought</hi> to prove what he ſaith, and <hi>himſelf ſo to walk even as he walked:</hi> To be in Chriſt, is to be a new creature. And theſe new Creatures do all reſemble him; for he is <hi>formed in them.</hi> Naming the name of Chriſt will never demonſtrate your Chriſtianity; unleſs you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity, which makes you ſo unlike unto your Lord.</p>
            <p>But likeneſs to him, will prove you His in Truth. And an evidence of this; what <hi>strong conſolation</hi> will it afford? If you are in Chriſt; how <hi>ſafe</hi> are you? you are ſecured from the <hi>curſe of the Law;</hi> the <hi>stroke</hi> of <hi>vindictive Juſtice;</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> of the <hi>Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>Corruption and Sin;</hi> the <hi>ſting</hi> of the <hi>firſt Death,</hi> and the power of the <hi>ſecond.</hi> If you are in Chriſt; <hi>His God is your God, his Father your Father,</hi> Joh. 20.17. <hi>You</hi> are loved as <hi>He</hi> is loved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.23. <hi>That the World may know, that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> And v. 26. <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi> You are <hi>joint-heirs</hi> with Chriſt unto the <hi>ſame incorruptible inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi> how firm and ſure is your title! how certain and ſoon will be your poſſeſſion! and after poſſeſſion is taken, you ſhall not be diſpoſſeſs'd unto Eternity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Your following the Example of Chriſt <hi>very much honours Him; and credits Chriſtianity,</hi> 'tis a ſign, that Chriſts death, has a mighty vertue in it, when it makes you to die to Sin; and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the biggeſt offers, that Mammon makes to you. 'Tis an argument that <hi>He is truly Chriſt,</hi> when you are <hi>truly Chriſtians;</hi> that <hi>He is indeed alive,</hi> when he <hi>lives in you,</hi> and makes you to <hi>live to</hi> him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>like</hi> him; 'Tis a demonſtration that our <hi>Lord is riſen indeed,</hi> when you <hi>riſe with him, and ſeek thoſe things that are above,</hi> Col. 3.1.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is very much <hi>unknown,</hi> and being unknown, is <hi>undeſired</hi> and neglected; becauſe ſo <hi>little of him is ſeen</hi> in <hi>Chriſtians converſation.</hi> How

            </p>
            <p>Be all of you prevailed with; to honour your Lord Jeſus; by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, what <hi>he was</hi> when here upon <hi>Earth;</hi> and how <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he works</hi> in you, though <hi>now</hi> he is in <hi>Heaven.

            <p n="6">6. Chriſt frequently <hi>ſpeaks to you to follow him; and obſerves whether, and how you do it.</hi> His word is plain, that you ſhould learn his Doctrine, and live after his example. And <hi>his eyes</hi> which are as a <hi>flaming fire:</hi> are upon <hi>Profeſſours ways.</hi> His Omniſcience ſhould be more firmly believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeriouſly conſidered by the Church it ſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. <hi>All the Churches ſhall know that I am He which ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts; and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</hi> I ſhall here by a <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> bring in our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> ſpeaking to you; and himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding his own Example, that you may hear, and heed, and follow the Lamb of God. To this effect Chriſt ſpeaks to you:</p>

I always trod in thoſe paths which to you will prove pleaſantneſs and peace; though to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy for your deviations, and going aſtray; I was fain my ſelf to be</hi> a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief. <hi>Conſider your Lord and Maſter; you that call your ſelves my diſciples.

            <p>
               <hi>When you yield to Satans temptations, are you like to me? When you are eager after worldly wealth; the applauſe of men; and fleſh-pleaſing delights; are you like to me?

            </p>
            <p>In the fourth and laſt place, I am to conclude with ſome <hi>Directions</hi> how you <hi>may be able to follow the Example of our Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let your unlikeneſs to Chriſt be <hi>matter of your great humiliation.</hi> It ſhould be your trouble, that you have been ſo <hi>long</hi> learning, and have <hi>learned Chriſt</hi> no better: That ſo much of the old Man remains to be put off; that no more of the new man is put on. Look upon the paſſions and luſts of the fleſh as ſo many foul blemiſhes, as ſo many deforming wrinkles of the Old <hi>Adam;</hi> the more of theſe, there is in you; they make you the more unlike to <hi>him who is altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Be humbled for your ſin, and hate it; that's the way to be rid of it. Sin <hi>cannot ſtand</hi> before a <hi>perfect hatred,</hi> but languiſhes and dies away; whereas love to it is the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Study more the <hi>admirable excellency and fairneſs of the copy Chriſt has ſet you.</hi> And how deſireable it is ſtill <hi>to be growing up</hi> more and more <hi>into him in all things.</hi> The beauty of Men and Angels is black to Chriſt's fairneſs; to be like Him, is to have that which truly deſerves the name of excellency; <hi>With open face</hi> and intentive eyes behold, as in <hi>a glaſs, the glory of your Lord, that you may be changed into the ſame image;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious your ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Being ſenſible of your <hi>own impotency, live by Faith on the Son of God.</hi> Remember 'tis in Him that you have <hi>both righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 45.24. Grace to be like Chriſt is from him. He ſtrengthens the <hi>weak hands;</hi> he confirms the <hi>feeble knees,</hi> that we may <hi>work</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> after his Example. If you ſhould attempt to do this in your <hi>own might;</hi> that attempt would be, not only <hi>vain,</hi> but an argument of your <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ignorance.</hi> Can the branch bear fruit of it ſelf? 'Tis from the Vine, that ſap is communicated to it, to make it fruitful: You muſt <hi>be,</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> in Chriſt, and ever be deriving life and virtue from Him; that you may bear fruit worthy of Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you; as the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me: I am the Vine; ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Give up your ſelves to <hi>the conduct of Chriſts own Spirit.</hi> How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is it ſaid, <hi>He that hath an ear, let him h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He will cauſe you to look unto Jeſus; and enable you to follow him, without turning aſide, or drawing back: Till you come to <hi>be where he is,</hi> and <hi>behold his glory:</hi> and then you will be <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his likeneſs;</hi> and be <hi>for ever with the Lord.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE inſpired Author of this profound, ſublime, nervous Epiſtle (whether St. <hi>Luke,</hi> or <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or <hi>Clement,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as I moſt think, I here diſpute not) is evidently walking in the ſearches of the great Excellency of Chriſtianity, as it was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by, and took its denomination from, and ſerves the purpoſes, and ſpeaks the Eminence, Unction, and Prerogatives and Deſigns of Chriſt the Son of God. And this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he here directeth to the Hebrews, by whom we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe Chriſtian Jews that were in <hi>Syria, Judea,</hi> and principally at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for thoſe that were diſperſed through the Provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, were commonly called <hi>Greeks.</hi> And thoſe indeed who were Converted to the Chriſtian Faith were terribly perſecuted
<pb facs="tcp:40119:145"/> by the <hi>Jews</hi> their Brethren, and aſſaulted by Seducers to work them back again to their deſerted Judaiſm; and much ado they had to ſtand their ground. Whereupon this Author (mindful of what his Lord had ſaid in <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 9-13.) attempts to ſhew the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies of their State, and that Judaiſm was every way tranſcended by Chriſtianity. The Author of it was a greater and better Perſon than <hi>Moſes, Aaron</hi> or <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> The <hi>Doctrines</hi> were more myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſublime. The <hi>Laws</hi> more ſpiritual, and moſt accurately ſuited to the compleating and perpetuating of the Divine Life and Nature in them; and to the advancing them unto all Conformities to God, imitations of him, and intimacies with him: The Promiſes were more glorious, rich and full; and all the Conſtitutions, Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Services, Miniſtry and Advantages of the Goſpel Polity and Temple, carried more glorious ſignatures of God upon them; and were more eminently atteſted, patronized and ſucceeded by God, than ever Judaiſm was, or than it could pretend unto. Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould it be deſerted, or coldly owned, or improved negligently or defectively?</p>
            <p>This Author having therefore gained his point, and throughly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the dignity of the Chriſtian ſtate and calling, beyond all poſſibility of grounded Cavils or competition; He next proceeds to ſhew theſe Hebrews the genuine and juſt improvement of what he had demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 19-39 xi, xii, xiii. 1-19.</p>
            <p>The Caſuiſtical conſideration of the Text, beſt ſerves the ſtated purpoſe of this hour. And that I may be evidently pertinent, clear, ſuccinct, and profitable, let me now lay the Caſe and Text together, and conſider them in their relative aſpects each toward the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Luke-warmneſs is the remiſsneſs or defectiveneſs of heat <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a middle thing betwixt cold and heat. When there is not heat enough in <hi>ſubjecto capaci,</hi> to ſerve the purpoſes, that ſuch a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances ſhould ſubſerve. Now God and Chriſt expect a fervent Spirit, burning and flaming Love; and in the Text, Love is here repreſented as needing <hi>Provocation. Heart-warmth</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>love</hi> ſuiting and accommodating it ſelf to worthy objects, according to their apprehended dignity, uſefulneſs, or concerns. Love is the endearing to our ſelves of apprehended Excellence or Goodneſs, and our letting out our ſelves, or the iſſuings forth of our pleaſed wills in correſpondent motions towards, repoſes in, obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiouſneſs to, and engagements for, what we admire and affect; for worth or excellence diſcerned, makes us accommodate our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pleaſure and concerns thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to its nature, place, and poſture towards us, and our affairs therewith. When therefore this Affection, Principle or Grace (or Paſſion, if Love may properly be called ſo) is grown too weak to fix the will, and to influence the life ſo as to pleaſe its God, and turns indifferent, and unconcerned and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the winds and weather change; this languor of the Heart and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:40119:145"/> Will, and its eaſineſs and proneneſs to be drawn off from God and things Divine, we call <hi>Luke-warmneſs;</hi> which is nothing elſe, indeed, but the ſluggiſhneſs and dulneſs of the heart and will to ſuch a degree, as that it is not duly affected with, nor ſtartled at, nor concerned inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately about what is truly excellent, and of great conſequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to us. And hence our Author phraſes it by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in that Love may and ought to be ſmart and keen, heating and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the powers of the Soul to excite all their vigours and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all their Functions with ſtrength and pleaſure. Conſider well, <hi>Cant.</hi> viii. 6, 7. ii <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14. i <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii 8. Heart unaffectedneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedneſs and inactivity, let Souls and their concerns, God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and the Matters of Chriſt's Kingdom, go and be as they will, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 20, 21. This is the malady to be cured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not ſo much a ſingle inſtance of luke-warmneſs, as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that the caſe ſpeaks of. Nor doth the Text intend an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Feaver in the heart; 'tis not a tranſient Paroxyſm, by fits and ſtarts for hearts to burn; but 'tis a ſtated frame that muſt be changed and fixt. The Malady is a <hi>luke-warm temper,</hi> a frame and conſtitution of the inward man, too weakly bent and byaſſed towards God and heavenly things, to make them ſtatedly its predominant ambition, buſineſs and delight, <hi>Act.</hi> xi. 23. ii <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 9. A frame of Soul that ſits too looſe towards God to do, to bear, to be, to hope, to wait much for him in the ſtormy and dark day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the effectual cure hereof that the caſe aims at; and in this Paroxyſm of Love and of Good Works the cure conſiſts. Hence, <hi>Labour of love,</hi> Heb. vi. 10. i <hi>Theſſ.</hi> i. 3. <hi>Love abounding more and more, in knowledge and in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent, that ye may be ſincere, and without offence, until the day of Chriſt; being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the Glory and Praiſe of God,</hi> Phil. i. 9.—11. when Love is fervent, fixt, and genuinely fruitful, then is this luke-warm temper cured indeed. Hence, <hi>zealous of good works.</hi> See <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 11.—14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How this Cure of ſuch a temper may be effectually wrought, is the next thing to be enquired into; and the great import of the caſe before us; and a great cluſter of apt and pertinent Expedients doth the Text here entertain us with Such as, 1. <hi>Determining and deſigning to enterprize the thing;</hi> here called <hi>Provocation to love and to good works,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>· This is the great concern to be eſpouſed, and the great ſcope of our intentions, reſolutions, and endeavours. Love, and good works, are the great Cure of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, to which we muſt direct our thoughts, words, deeds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokingly. <hi>Col</hi> iv. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6 Such a Diſtemper muſt not be ordinarily expected to be cured by accident; nor are their Labours likely to be proſperous, who do not cordially deſign this Cure. 2 <hi>The mutual Conſiderations of Perſons. Conſider one another to a Provocation.</hi> So the Greek. We muſt take into ſerious, deep and frequent thoughts, the
<pb facs="tcp:40119:146"/> quality, capacity, ſpirits, courſes and concerns of one another, and ſee wherein they are defective, or exemplary and proficient in theſe things; as alſo how to qualify our ſelves, and how to manage our ſpirits, ſpeeches and behaviour, to the procurement of this end; and how to provoke our ſelves to Love, and to Good Works, by what we ſee in others, and hear from them or concerning them, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 14. i <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 14, 15. for we are all of us obnoxious unto very great decays in Chriſtian Affections and Behaviour (and who is free throughout from guilt herein?) and equally concerned in this healthful exerciſe and temper. 3. <hi>Actual Endeavours</hi> upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to <hi>fix the temper and behaviour right;</hi> for thoughts and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are vain things till they be put in execution. Such as <hi>Mutual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> attending on aſſembling of our ſelves together, and our growthful progreſs in theſe things, under the reinforcements and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repreſentations of the approaching day. Hence then conſider we, 1. The Text. 2. The Caſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Text.</p>
            <p>And here we have, 1. The <hi>Objects</hi> to be conſidered; <hi>one another.</hi> 2. The <hi>Duty</hi> here required as converſant about theſe Objects, <hi>Conſider.</hi> 3. The <hi>End, Provocation to love and to good works.</hi> 4. The means and manner of performing it to purpoſe, and with good Succeſs, <hi>not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting one another.</hi> 5. The great inducement hereunto, <hi>ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching.</hi> Improving the thoughts, belief and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this approaching ſolemn day, and conſequently, our concerns therein as the moſt awful motive and quickning encouragement of our Preparatory State and Work.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt premiſe, that the caſe here propoſed to our preſent thoughts may and muſt be reſolved into two. 1. How a luke-warm temper may be cured by us in <hi>our ſelves:</hi> 2. How to be cured in <hi>each other.</hi> Now ſeeing we are all related to the ſame God, and under the ſame circumſtances as to our capacity of pleaſing or diſpleaſing God, of deſerting or adhering to our Chriſtian State and work; and all of us, <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> under the ſame powerful and manifold obligations to be found Right and Faithful in this day. And as all of us are determined to ſolemn Judgment, and an Eternal State, according to the temper of our Spirits, and tenor of our Lives, as found to be when that day comes. What can we ſay to one another, to <hi>provoke each other to love and to good works, that will not equally concern our ſelves?</hi> Whatever then we conſider in each other, is as conſiderable in our ſelves. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we deſign hereby to provoke others regularly to, is to be equally deſigned, and enterprized, and promoted upon our ſelves. Whatever we ſpeak to others, or plead with others, hath the ſame Errand to, and ought deſervedly to be as cogent and prevailing with our ſelves. We are all concerned in the helpfulneſs of preſent Aſſemblies, and in the proceſs and reſults of the laſt general Aſſembly; and what we
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40119:146"/> propoſe or preſs by way of Counſel, Requeſt, Encouragement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be as ſpoken to our ſelves. Taking it then for granted and concluded, and needleſs to be proved and demonſtrated, 1. That luke-warmneſs is an heart-diſtemper. 2. And that the formal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it lies in the remiſsneſs of due Affections unto their proper worthy objects: and ſo in too mean reſentments, and diſtaſtings of whatever is contrary thereunto. 3. That the Cure of this Diſtemper formally conſiſts in the due fervour of provoked Love, invigorating and producing its congenial Operations, and Effects (here called Good Works, which are but anſwerableneſs of Practice and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to this Principle, or Grace.) 4. And that all theſe means and courſes which genuinely and ſtatedly relate hereto as divinely inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him, whoſe Bleſſing is entailed hereon, to make them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and ſucceſsful hereunto, are the moſt likely means to work this Cure. 5. And that the purport of my Text amounts to this, and is it ſelf of Divine Inſpiration; and ſo of God's appointment for this End. Taking, I ſay, theſe things for granted, for brevities ſake, I ſhall diſpatch the Text and Caſe together, in the cloſe Conſideration of theſe three General Heads or Topicks of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The things to be provoked to, <hi>Love and Good Works;</hi> for herein the Cure conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The things that are moſt likely, and prepared to provoke hereto; and ſo the Remedy or Means will be directed to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Courſe and Method of improving theſe moſt regularly; and ſo the skilful, faithful management thereof will be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The things to be provoked to.</p>
            <p>

We are hereby both rendred and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his Witneſſes that he is God, and the beſt Object of our Love.

In his Creation of the Univerſe of Beings. 3. In his Relations conſequent upon Creation, and avouchedly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by him. 4. In thoſe various Signatures and Explications of his Name, that are upon the whole, and every part of his Creation; according to the various Habitudes and States thereof. 5. And in his relative deportments towards them, and Communications to them, as they are capable of receiving them. 2. Jeſus Chriſt in all his Mediatorial Excellencies, Dignities and Prerogatives, in his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Offices, Unction, Performances and Acqueſts both <hi>for himſelf,</hi> as one exalted now to his Fathers right hand: And for us, as our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and engaged Head in all his Sympathies and Endearments. 3. The Holy Ghoſt, as God our Sanctifier in all thoſe Counſels, Quicknings, Comforts, which he provideth for us, offereth to us, and ſucceedeth in us and upon us. And 4. Thoſe that are near and dear to God, according to the various meaſures of their Unction, Stations, and Serviceableneſs unto God; and here comes in the main deſign both of my Text, and Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That we Chriſtians, be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered each by other, as that Chriſtian Excellencies be obſerved to mutual Inflammations of Endearments where they are; that Chriſtian Principles and Affections may be awakened, invigorated and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, where they are dormant, idle or decayed, and that accordingly thoſe Goſpel means and helps be valued duely and pertinently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and improved, which may reduce us to, and keep us in the fervours and vigours of our Chriſtian love, that ſo the love of our eſpouſals may fix and center in the God of Love, and have its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and kindly Circulations and Diffuſions through the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and every thing abhorred, reſiſted, and rejected, that ſhall or would attempt a rape thereon. For towards theſe glorious and lovely
<pb facs="tcp:40119:148"/> Objects, there ſhould be no indifference, nor cold affections, nor the leaſt poſſibility of a divorce therefrom, that we by any Diligence, Providence, or Reſolution can prevent. Whatever as to Things and Perſons, is really and evidently of God and for him, be it in us, with us, or about us, muſt not ſit looſly on our Hearts, for it is the Chriſtian Religion, as it imprinciples Souls for God, and Chriſt, and forms them after God, and Chriſt, and keeps them faithful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in their practical devotedneſs to the Divine deſign upon us, that fits us for, and keeps us in the State and Spirit of endearment unto God, ii <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 2. — 11. and that muſt imprinciple, and actuate our reciprocal affections and endearments each towards other.

The Kingdom of God, and Chriſt muſt be endeared to us, with all the Subjects of that Kingdom, in all their univerſally holding Principles, and Intereſts. And the great fervours, vigours and effects of Love muſt be directed to, and ſetled upon theſe objects, proportionably to their excellencies and poſtures towards us, and our concerns with them, and Relations to them. This for the Objects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The formal nature of this Love; and here I ſhall premiſe, that it is beſt underſtood and known by its own exerciſed, and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vigour. Senſation helps us to the cleareſt, and moſt lively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, the moſt accurate Definitions and Deſcriptions, that can be given us by the moſt ſagacious and exact Perſons can never tell you to ſuch degrees of ſatisfaction in your information; what Health or Sickneſs, Hunger or Thirſt, Pain or Eaſe, Light or Darkneſs, Sweetneſs or Bitterneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are, as one hours experience of your own will do. Men that are born blind, have not by all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of reading to them, or diſcourſing with them, ſuch clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of light, as a little opening of their own Eyes will help them to; Beauty and Melody are and muſt be ſeen and heard before they can be duly underſtood; but as far as I am able, I ſhall adventure to deſcribe it thus.</p>
            <p>Love is the Pleaſure of the Heart or Will in the diſcerned and valued excellency of its object. So as delightfully to make it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it ſelf unto the Nature, Pleaſure, and concerns thereof. Or it is the endearment of apprehended excellence, ſo as to ſweeten all our contemplations, and eſteem thereof; our motions towards it, our repoſes in it, our ſufferings and adventures for it, and our repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and abode therein. Here we may briefly note theſe things. 1. When its Object doth evidently tranſcend our reach and pitch in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40119:148"/> then the formal Act of Love is a delightful Admiration of Perfection. Infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs caſt us upon the heighths and depths of wonder and aſtoniſhment, and entertain us with the higheſt ſatisfactions in our ſevereſt, and moſt awful Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations thereof; theſe raviſhing views or thoughts of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible ſource and abyſs of Perfection, which is Eſſential Goodneſs, and the very heighth thereof, (for what is Goodneſs, but the heighth of Excellency?) affect us with the moſt reverend ſence thereof. 2. Where excellency appears as capable of being ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth by imitations and reſemblances, and challenges our Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities thereunto, the formal act of Love is a pleaſed attempering of it ſelf unto its much valued and endeared object; joyfully loving and endeavouring a correſpondency and agreement with all the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable excellencies and allurements of ſuch a valuable and admired pattern and exemplar; thus love is an ambitious imitation of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red worth, pleaſing it ſelf in all it's gradual approaches to it's Object, in it's attainments of what moſt reſembles him, whoſe mirrours we ſo much long and pleaſe our ſelves to be: Thus our Chriſtian love (our Love to God, and unto Chriſt his Image) in it's nature, it's operations, and attainments is but the impreſs of Divine Perfections upon our ſelves, with all the ſolaces, which ariſe in and from our thus transformed ſelves. 3. When excellency appears upon the Theater, ſhewing it's luſtre in exquiſite performances and Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, bearing the Signatures of that Name, whoſe works they are, (<hi>as the Inviſible things of God are known, by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. i. 20.) Then the formal Act of Love is Pleaſure in our notices and obſervations of the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the cauſe appearing in the effects thereof, and in our delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſearches thereinto. 4. When excellency appears upon the Throne of Government, the formal Act of Love is our delightful acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſatisfaction in, and our chearful comporting with all the Laws and Intereſts of ſuch Government: Thus <hi>I delight to do thy will, O God,</hi> Pſal. xl. 8. <hi>And this is love that we keep his Commandments,</hi> i Joh. v. 3. <hi>And this is my meat, to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work,</hi> Joh. iv. 34. Authority owned, Laws obeyed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals reſted in, and all with chearfulneſs. And then, 5. When Goodneſs appears communicative, deſigning and diſpenſing kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, directed and deſigned to the benefit, and welfare of the Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of it's Communications. The formal Act of Love in the thus befriended Perſons, is their thankful acceptances, chearful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, and faithful improvement, of what they thus receive in the ſervice, according to the Pleaſure and Order, and to the praiſe of him that gives them; and as theſe favours are of ſeveral ſorts and ſizes; Such as our <hi>beings,</hi> and their receptiveneſs of Divine kindneſſes; and the kindneſs ſhewed us to make us good, to do us good, and to capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate us to do good to others, and to receive further good from God,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:149"/> according to our different capacities, ſtations, relations, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and advantages, conditions, and other circumſtances; ſo hath our Love it's diverſified actings, expreſſions and effects, according to it's various objects, conſidered in their own proper Excellencies, their ſeveral Relations to us, their poſtures towards us, and their concerns with us, and ours with them, which I here cannot menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much leſs enlarge upon, even as they and we are related and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with the eſſential ſource of all communicative Excellence or Goodneſs, and therefore I leave it to the deeper thoughts and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearches of better Heads and Hearts than mine. 6. When Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence eſpouſes evidently ſome great Intereſts and Deſigns, ſuch as the recovery of loſt Souls, the reparation of declined Holineſs, the ſhaming and abandoning of all Sin, the utter extirpation of Satans Intereſt and Kingdom, the erecting of his Goſpel, Houſe and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Exaltation of his Son, and the Edification of his Children in Chriſtian Knowledge, Holineſs and Comfort; and in all things fit to make them acceptable to himſelf, and approved of men; and to make them regular and eaſie in themſelves. When God deſigns and proſecutes the ſpreading of the Goſpel, the Sanctification of his Name in and before the eyes of all, and the compleating the Divine Life, and Nature in his own: What then can be the formal Act of Love, hereto in us, but the endearment and eſpouſal of theſe things to us, as matters of the higheſt conſequence and importance to the World, the Church and us, and as things more valuable and delightful to us, in our contemplations and purſuits thereof, than all our perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Pleaſures in this World? 7. When Excellence commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates it ſelf diſcernibly to others, then Love rejoyces in this Gift and Grace to them. 8. When Excellence appears communicable to others, and that through one another as appointed means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for this end, then Love is ſo far thankful, and it covets, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, deſigns and proſecutes the thing, and ſo it grieves or joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Triumphs, as it diſcerns the matter to ſucceed or to be defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or delayed; and it forms, and cheriſhes, and exerts it Sympathies accordingly. 9. When Excellence is rivall'd, confronted, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then Love turns Jealous and Enraged; and puts on fortitude, and reſolution to ſtand by it's darling Object and concerns, in all the Agonies of Contention for them, which they need; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the hazards, coſt and difficulties which attend them. And 10. It accounts, and uſes all as Friends or Enemies, as they appear againſt or for it's Object.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Genuine Practice and Productions of this love. Here they are called <hi>Good Works;</hi> a correſpondent practice with this Divine and Active, and diffuſive Principle.

Love is the very Soul of Godlineſs, the very Heart of the new Man; a Principle ſo impetuous and charming, as that it ſcorns where it is Regent, to be confined to, or ſignalized by any thing mean or baſe; Such objects and concerns in its moſt intimate and cloſe embraces, and in its ſtated proſpect, and yet act ſparingly, ſordidly, or ſneakingly for God! Love burns and bluſhes at the thought. And Heaven it ſelf ere long will irritate, exert and ſhew the Purity and generous Vigours of this Grace, in ſuch a ſtated and inviolable ſeries of great and generous actions, ſo full of God, and every way ſo fully for him, and ſo worthy of him, as that the life of God in glory ſhall evidence the force and excellence of that ſpring and principle whence it proceeds; and yet even here, even in this its Infant and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State, it groans and labours to have God's Will done on Earth as it is in Heaven.

<pb facs="tcp:40119:150"/> and energies of your enflamed, exalted, and invigorated Souls, through love to God, Chriſt, Souls and Chriſtianity. O to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in all Converſation! to live each other into awakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of Spiritual concerns, to dart forth all thoſe glorious rays of Chriſtian Wiſdom, of which we are told in <hi>Jam.</hi> iii. 17, 18. to make men feel, as well as ſee, the force and flames of Chriſtian Love; to charm Exaſperated Paſſions down by all the ſweetneſſes of true Wiſdom, Patience, Meekneſs, Gentleneſs, and every way endearing Converſation with them; to have the Law of Kindneſs always in your Mouths, the notices of true Friendlineſs in your Looks, the gifts and proofs of generous Charity in your Hands, in conſtant readineſs to miniſter to the Neceſſities of the Saints, as God ſhall proſper your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in your lawful and regularly managed Occupations and Employments; to have your Dealings and Commerces each with other accurately and ſeverely juſt, and yet ſufficiently ſecuring the credit and concerns of Chriſtianity.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40119:150"/> and its repoſes in its <hi>Pearl of Price:</hi> and hence its actions are invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; it gives no faint blows in its holy War, it runs not in its Race, it deals not triflingly in its Merchandize for God and Heaven; it is all mettle, fortitude, patience, action, deſire and delight in every thing relating to its grand Affair and Scope; and it makes all its actions and performances to bear their Teſtimony to its own fortitude and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and this is the Paroxyſm of Love and Good Works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The things provoking hereto.</p>
            <p>And here behold a Troop, as it was ſaid of <hi>Gad,</hi> Gen. xxx. 11. How do inducements and incentments ſpring up in manifold and mighty cluſters? What can we mention or fix our thoughts upon, that may not kindle and increaſe this flame of Love, and its Eruptions in Good Works? The things which we might pertinently and copiouſly inſiſt upon, might be reduced to theſe Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Objects of this Central Grace or Principle: 1. Things in Heaven; as God, Chriſt, the Spirit, Angels, the Spirits of Juſt Men there made perfect; the glorious Furniture, Laws and Orders; the Viſions, Services, Miniſtrations and Fruitions of that State; all the Perfections Prerogatives and Employments of that bleſſed World above; with all the accompliſhments and accommodations which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late immediately thereto, and all the Satisfactions and Advantages that reſult therefrom. 2. Things from Heaven; <hi>God manifest in the fleſh,</hi> i <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16. the Spirit, Works, and Word of God, the great Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Engagements of Divine Providence for us, all that we are, or have, or meet with, expreſs of God's merciful regards to us, and his compaſſionate concernedneſs for our univerſal welfare. 3. Things for Heaven; The Spirit of Grace, the Word of Grace, all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and means of Grace, with all the Diſcipline and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Providence ſenſibly affords us: the Good and Evil things of time, as ordered by God to fit us for, and help us to the Glory which we look for. The very <hi>Sons of men</hi> themſelves conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the relations which they bear to God, and their expreſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his indearing Name, and all thoſe marks and notices which they bear and give us in the frame, capacity and management of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, of God's incomprehenſible Wiſdom, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O who can think hereon, and yet be unprovoked to Love and to Good Works, when as God is ſo eminently and endearingly diſcernible in all? for God by all this courts our love. And ſhould I ſpeak of the Sons of God and Heirs of Glory, that Divine Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip which is in them, and upon them; the Impreſſions, Reflections and Refractions of the Divine Nature and Life; their capacity of growing up to all the fulneſs of God, and to be eternally the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and delightſome Temple of the Holy Ghoſt; all their relations to the Holy Trinity, with all their obligations to him, their intereſt in him, their buſineſs with him and for him, and all their imitations and reſemblances of him in their actual and poſſible motions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
<pb facs="tcp:40119:151"/> towards him, and their Great Expectations from him. Should I inſiſt upon their memberſhip, with all the duties and advantages, and pleaſures which ariſe there from; and pertinently illuſtrate and apply (as I could eaſily and quickly do) what doth ſo copiouſly occur, in <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 4.—6. as the Central articles and holding bonds of Union and Endearments; would you and I conſider all theſe things, and all the lovelineſs that would then be communicable or obſervable, could our love want its provocation!</p>
            <p n="2">2. The formal nature of this love; 'tis fit to be a provocation to itſelf, i <hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 16-21.7-12. This is the beauty, health, ſtrength, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſafety and renown of humane nature; love is the aim and ſcope Knowledge, the end of faith, the Spirit of hope, the life of practice and devotion and the bond of perfectneſs, and the true transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Soul into the image of its God. No pleaſing thoughts of God, Chriſt, Heaven or heavenly things, no chearful motions towards eternity, no foretaſts of the higheſt bliſs, no warrantable claims thereto, nor confident expectations of unſeen realities. No true and laſting bonds of friendlineſs in ſervice and affections, without this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ſtate of love; this only faces God in his own beautiful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful image; this only turns the notions of divinity into ſubſtantial realities; and ſo exalts the man above the pageantries of meer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, outſide ſervice and devotions; and the truth is, all that we ſay and do for God, or with him, and all our expectations from him are but the tricks and forgeries of deceitful and deceived fools, and the moſt provoking Prophanation of the tremendous, holy name of God, and an abuſe of holy things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſervices which love muſt do and the fruits it muſt produce to God, to Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto the Spirit, unto our ſelves and others. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt be reverenced, addreſt unto, ſerved and entertained like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and walked with in all required and fit imitations of himſelf. And all theſe cannot be without juſt valuings of and complacency in his eminent perfections, near relations and the admirable conſtitutions and adminiſtrations of his Kingdom. Chriſt muſt be duly thought on, heartily entertained, gratefully acknowledged, and cheerfully obeyed, ſubmitted and improved unto the great and gracious purpoſes of his appearances, performances and Kingdom, and minded moſt delightfully in all the Grandeurs of his Grace and Throne; the Holy Spirit muſt poſſeſs his Temple to his full Satisfaction, and have the pure incenſe of his graces in their fragrant, liberal and continual aſcents; (<hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt, Jude</hi> 20.) And be feaſted with the growthful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant productions of his graces, both in their bloſſoms and full fruits; and we muſt be continually ſowing to him, if we hope to reap eternal life of him, in <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 8. We muſt poſſeſs our ſelves in God, and for him, in our full devotedneſs and reſignations of our entire ſelves to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaſing our ſelves in this, that we are not by far ſo much, and ſo delightfully our own as his, and that we cannot love our ſelves ſo well
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40119:151"/> as when we find God infinitely dearer to us than we are to our ſelves. And as for others, much muſt we chearfully do, and bear, and be, to bring poor Renegadoes back again to God, to teſtify our great reſpects unto, and pleaſure in the grace of God in our fellow Chriſtians, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate our ſelves to their edification &amp; concerns; and to make our beſt advantage of every thing diſcernible in them: Helping our ſelves and them in ſpirit, ſpeech and practice. And can theſe things be brought to paſs, or our ſelves reconciled &amp; ſuited to all our Chriſtian duties and intereſts without provoked love? And for the ſolemnities, tranſactions and reſults of the <hi>approaching day,</hi> what is that day to thoſe who have no love, or very great declenſions of it? For all that come with Chriſt from Heaven, come in the flames of love to God, to godlineſs and Godly Ones: and a Cold Heart, will no way be endured there. And as to fellow Chriſtians the Duties and Counſels of the Text, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, adhering to the Aſſembling of our ſelves together, mutual exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> in the encouraging and quickning Proſpect of this day, can theſe things be without love?</p>
            <p n="3">III. The management of theſe provoking things.</p>
            <p>And here let us follow the method of the Text it ſelf. Where we have theſe Topicks to inſiſt upon. 1. Perſons muſt be conſidered <hi>each other,</hi> and our ſelves. 2. We are not to deſert the Aſſemblings of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is. 3. We muſt exhort each other. And ſo what one propoſes the other muſt Conſider, Entertain Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate and Improve, to the great ends and benefit of the exhortation given. 4. And the actuated knowledge of the approaching day muſt quicken us to and in the more ſerious and intenſe performance of theſe duties: <hi>Exhorting by ſo much the more, by how much the more as ye ſee the day approaching.</hi> Let me but touch a little upon theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>conſider one another</hi> for this provoking work, or in order to <hi>this Provocation.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The word here in the Text imports ſtrict obſervation of, and great ſollicitouſneſs of thoughts about each other, as to great matters for their Good. So that we have, 1. The <hi>Objects; each other.</hi> 2. The <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> towards them; <hi>Let us Conſider.</hi> 3. The end and ſcope; <hi>To a provocation unto love and to Good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Objects. One another.</hi> 1. As to the great and Stated ends of our Creation and Redemption. Such as the Divine nature, and Life, and Joy. Gods image in us, ſervice from us, and the delightful bliſsful (and that) eternal preſence with us, in the glorious diſcoveries and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of himſelf to us in heaven. And as we are recovered &amp; redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Jeſus Chriſt; So our loyalty, gratitude and fruitfulneſs to him, in all acknowledgements and improvements of his kind Conduct, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Providence and Grace, unto the Fathers Glory through him. As we are related to the Holy Ghoſt it is our correſpondent Temper and Practice with, Improvement of, and our fit returns unto, the Offered, Accepted and Profeſt relations of the Spirit and his Communications to us, his Operations in us and his Effects upon our Spirits, that he
<pb facs="tcp:40119:152"/> might thereby ſuit us to the Concerns &amp; Priviledges of our Chriſtian ſtate, and that we might be built up, furniſht and poſſeſt as the Eternal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the living God. Linked and laid together; and ſo, related and obliged to each other, dependant each on other, and conſequently uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and delightful, in being heartily and practically faithful each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto the Edification of the whole in love; that ſo God (three in One) may be eternally and evidently <hi>All</hi> to Univerſal Satisfaction. For we were made and bought, and are committed to the care of Chriſt and of the Spirit; and we are accordingly entruſted with Goſpel helps and means, that we might hereby be the Mirrours of Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable excellencies and perfections, the Monuments of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and rich Grace, and Inſtruments of ſpecial Service. For theſe ends God Created and Redeemed us, and in reſpect hereto are we to be conſidered each by other. 2. As to our capacity of ſerving and reaching ſuch Great Ends and Purpoſes. The powers of our Souls, the members of our Bodies, and all our natural accommodations for theſe Ends. For we are men, and ſo have faculties and powers naturally capable of, and formed to a propenſeneſs and appetite to the Supream Good, and thereupon receptive of all the attractive influences of the firſt cauſe; and were it not for our moral depravations, and Corruptions, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of heart herefrom which we have ſinfully contracted, eſpouſed and indulged; conſidering Divine Diſcoveries, Aſſiſtances and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, procured for us, and diſpenſed to us by Jeſus Chriſt; what hinders our return to God and unto thoſe reciprocations of Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments betwixt him and us, to which by our rational Frame and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution we are ſo admirably ſuited? Are we not capable of diſcerning what may excite, enflame, preſerve and regulate our love, and of the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and managing it accordingly? We are capable of judgment, choice and motion, and repoſes, right objects being ſet before us in their apt illuſtrations and addreſſes. So that we cannot ſpeak to bruits and ſtones as we may do to men. For nothing but ſinful ignorance, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, negligence and malignity, or ſad deluſions and miſtakes, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs, and unreaſonable avocations and diverſions, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the return of our firſt love; and all theſe things may be redreſt by our judicious, well adviſed and warm diſcourſes about theſe things duly attended to, impartially conſidered, and prudently and pertinently applied unto our ſelves. Thus miſtakes may be Rectified, known Truths and Notions actuated, Hearts affected, Lives reformed, and Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its regular Fervours and Productions of Good works. He that is capable of knowing what he is to do, and why, and of doing and being what moſt concerns and beſt becomes him, deſerves to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly conſidered by us. 3. As to our obligations and advantages, as we are Creatures, Subjects, Favourites. As we are redeemed to God by Chriſt, ſo our obligations to the returns of Gratitude ſhould be conſidered by us, ii <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 14, 15. We are Chriſts, and Gods by him, and ſo he muſt be glorified in the whole man, i <hi>Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:40119:152"/> vi. 20. And all the vaſt advantages of our Goſpel day, as they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and encouraging advantages put into our hands, muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by us too, and our ſelves and one another as Stewards entruſted and accountable, ii <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 3, 4. i 4.11. So that we muſt regard each other as under ties and bonds to God and Chriſt, and as greatly helped and furniſhed to be provoked thus, if well conſidered, and managed accordingly. 4. As to our Spirits and behaviour according to our Chriſtian Claims and Helps, Relations, Obligations and Profeſſions. Whether we foot it right or not, <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 14. Whether profeſſours value their Souls to their juſt worth or not, in keeping them intent upon their great concern, &amp; whether their furniture, diſcipline, temper and behaviour bear evidently their fit and full proportion hereunto. How Goſpel transforming and reforming work goes on with them. Whether the Chriſtian name and intereſt, the Goſpel and its Patron be credited and promoted, or diſgraced and hindred by us; and whether our proficiency and improvements be anſwerable indeed to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, obligations and profeſſions. 5. Wherein our helps and hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or our dangers mainly lye; their Gifts, and Graces, and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Advantages, on the one hand: Their Conſtitutions, Cuſtoms, Callings, Company, Temptations and ſecular Concerns, and Hindrances on the other hand are all to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi> towards theſe Objects. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Let us <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> 1. Bend your minds to obſervation of one another, that ye may underſtand how matters are with one another; concern your ſelves about the right knowledge of the principles, tempers, actions, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and concerns of perſons, ſo far as your duty towards them calls you to it. For this injunction doth not countenance what we find elſewhere forbidden, ii <hi>Theſ.</hi> iii. 11, 12. i <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 13. i <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 15. So far as you may do or get Good, prevent redreſs or allay evil, under ſuch circumſtances, relations and advantages as may notify that God then calls you to it, and ſo encourages your expectations and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of doing Good, or preventing the ſin and miſchief which God would have prevented by you; So far may others be inſpected, enquired after, and obſerved by you. But when it is and evidently appears to be to no purpoſe, to ill purpoſes, or to needleſs purpoſe, you muſt not do it. 2. And then ſeriouſly pauſe upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and duly weigh, what you diſcern by your enquiry or your more immediate obſervation, and do not partially, paſſionately, raſhly, and cenſoriouſly, form and fix your meaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Give what you hear or ſee concerning one another, your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ſerious and Impartial thoughts, that ſo matters of fact being duly and truly ſtated, meaſures of prudence may be adviſedly and ſafely taken up and fixt upon. So that when perſons, matters of fact, your Chriſtian rules and work, and way of managing this great concern, are duly laid in the balance of the Sanctuary and all this fixed in its juſt reference to this weighty end, you may proceed accordingly in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, Tenderneſs and Wiſdom of the right Chriſtian Spirit. And
<pb facs="tcp:40119:153"/> then 3. Be well adviſed about the moſt taking way of managing what you <hi>thus</hi> inſtruct your ſelves about; the humour of the perſon, your ways &amp; ſeaſons of addreſſing your diſcourſes to him, &amp; the preſerving or managing of your intereſt in him, or at leaſt your own abilities to prove what you accuſe him of, to demonſtrate what arguments you advance and uſe, and to enforce the motives that you would preſs him with. And ſtudy your ſelves into a juſt meaſure of your own abilities, a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Maſtery and Command of your own Paſſions, and good and clear diſcerning of and inſight into the fitteſt ſeaſons and occaſions. And well obſerve as far as may be mens Tempers, Intereſts, Ends, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, that you may hereby, charm them, win and govern them. And if you would know men throughly, mind them ſtrictly in their Truſts, their Paſſions, Intereſts, Companions, Surprizes and Neceſſities, and let each other have ſerious thoughts herein. 4. And overlook no good in others to leſſen it, deſpiſe it, diſgrace it, or neglect it, but think diſtinctly upon all you ſee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The End and Scope of all muſt be this <hi>provocation to love and to Good works,</hi> Eph. iv. 29, 15, 16. i Theſ. v. 11. <hi>the tongue of the wiſe, uſeth knowledge aright, Prov.</hi> xv. 2. Therefore the mind and heart muſt be intent upon right ends, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 19. Not to let others know the reaches of our thoughts, the furniture of our minds, the nimbleneſs of our Tongues, the neatneſs of our words or the briskneſs of our parts or fancies, nor to ſpy faults, or weakneſſes, for our diſcurſive enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: As the manner of ſome is. Much leſs to make them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes to our opinions, parties or perſwaſions in lower matters, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to our particular intereſts, or humours, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 27. ii. 19-21. I wiſh Profeſſours, Miniſters and others, would read theſe Texts, and well conſider them. We muſt inſpect, obſerve and well conſider one another; that where we obſerve warm hearts, and fruitful lives, we might by our Commendations provoke them unto perſeverance and proficiency therein; that where we diſcern a mixture of things Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and blame-worthy, what is divine may not be overlooked, becauſe of what is culpable, nor what is faulty, imitated and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, becauſe of what is there praiſe-worthy. And that where we find our brethren overtaken with their infirmities and defects, they may be dealt with in the Spirit of meekneſs, and ſo recovered from their declenſions and defects: And ſo return to their firſt love. And that we our ſelves may be provoked to and by their excellencies, and grow more effectually careful to avoid all that did aſſwage their holy Warmth and Vigor. He that conſiders others, to glory over their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and neglects, to aggravate their ſlips and falls, more to expoſe their perſons to rage and ſcorn, doth what the Devil would adviſe him to, were he conſulted with. The truths of God and Soul concerns are fixed things, and fervent hearts, and fruitful lives, are the Souls grand affair. And he that minds his brother in the neglect hereof, hath a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and cold heart to purpoſe. To make each other all light about
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40119:153"/> the things of God and Chriſt, all fervour in our love thereto, and all regular and chearful vigour in the purſuit thereof, is what we muſt deſign, and direct our perſonal conſiderations to.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us not forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is: Here note, 1. The thing not here to be deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Our aſſembling.</hi> 2. The thing relating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto forbidden, is our <hi>forſaking it.</hi> 3. The tempting inſtance hereof, propoſed by way of warning to us, is, that the manner of ſome is thus to do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The thing not to be forſaken, imports either, 1. Our own Conventions for publick Worſhip; in the general, our open meeting together, as an Organized Congregation: Or Aſſembly wherein Paſtours and their Flocks aſſemble ſtatedly to ſpeak to God, and to hear from him, and Sacramentally to eat and drink before him; and ſo to recognize and repreſent our Chriſtian ſtate with all ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in open view together. Or, 2. Doing this without dividing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſeparations each from other, under the notion of Jew and Gentile, or of perſons differing each from other about difficult or trifling things. 3. Or our gathering others unto the Church of Chriſt, by our orderly and alluring Carriage, in this and other points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and ſo the additions, which hereafter God will make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Or 4. The great Aſſembly of the compleated, and Triumphant Church of Chriſt in the great day of his Appearance and Kingdom, ii <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 1. The only place that I remember in the New Teſtament, beſides my Text, that this Noun occurs: And in that place the Word (as here it is) being a decompound, it fitly may be rendred an after Synagogue, or gathering, and how far thus rendring it in the Text is countenanced by the laſt clauſe; [that day] I here determine not.</p>
            <p>But I will here conſider it in the firſt ſence, wave or lightly touch upon the other two, and transfer the laſt to the Conſideration of the laſt clauſe of the Text; where it will be freer from Exceptions than here perhaps it would be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The thing here given in charge concerning it, is. <hi>That we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it not.</hi> 1. In <hi>Thought,</hi> as judging it to be no <hi>Help</hi> or <hi>Duty.</hi> 2. In <hi>Heart,</hi> as not attempered, and reconciled to the ſolemnity, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and great concerns thereof. 3. In <hi>Preſence,</hi> as abandoning or neglecting our perſonal preſence and attendance there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Snare,</hi> that we are warned of here, is, <hi>Our being influenced into a deſerting ſuch Aſſemblies, by the practical declenſions and neglects of others.</hi> Others do ſo, they uſe to do it; it is evidently their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Practice, 'tis poſſible for you to do the ſame, and to be drawn thereto by their Example: But their Example cannot juſtifie this practice, and therefore ſhould not influence you hereinto, and this Caution may prevent it, and therefore ſhould accordingly be conſidered and improved by you; as being of ſuch manifeſt and
<pb facs="tcp:40119:154"/> mighty conſequence to your Love and Practice, both as to the warmth and ſtrength thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> of the worſhipping Aſſemblies of Saints, and Chriſtians, to this great and needful provocation muſt quicken us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and keep us in theſe Courts of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> .xcii. 13. — 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 24. <hi>There God commands the bleſſing, even Life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. cxxxiii. 3. There you have the openings of the Goſpel Teaſury; there are theſe golden Candleſticks, which bear the burning, ſhining Tapers, whoſe light and heat diffuſe themſelves through all within their reach, who are receptive of them: The Gifts and Graces the Affections and Experiences of Goſpel Miniſters are in their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Exerciſes; there God the Father ſets and keeps his Heart and Eye; there the Lord Redeemer walks by, and amongſt his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated Officers and Repreſentatives, diſpenſing warmth and vigour through their Miniſtry to Hearts preſented to him at his Altar: There doth the Holy Spirit fill Heads with Knowledge, Hearts with Grace, and all our Faculties and Chriſtian Principles with Vigour. There My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries are unfolded, Precepts explained and enforced, Promiſes fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in Soul improvements; Incenſe is offered up in golden Cenſers, and foederal concernments are ſolemnly tranſacted and confirmed in open Court. And there through the Angel of the Covenant his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the Waters of the Sanctuary, are Soul diſtempers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions healed: And there you are informed, acquainted with, and confirmed in, what may inſtruct you in, and encourage you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Provocation to Love and to good works:</hi> And there Prayer gets fuel, and gives vent to Love, drawing forth all the Energies of Souls and Thoughts towards God. And thus fervent Prayers, and love quickning returns thereto, are like the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending from and upon the Heart; while the deſerters hereof grow cold thereto, and ſtarve their Love and practical Godlineſs thereby. All there is known, obtained and exerciſed. There you may fill your Heads with Knowledge, your Hearts with Grace, your Mouths with Arguments, your Lives with Fruitfulneſs, your Conſciences with Conſolations; and your whole ſelves with thoſe experiences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine regards to Soul concerns, which may inflame your Hearts with Love to God and Chriſt, to Holineſs and Heaven, and fit you both to kindle and increaſe this holy flame both in your ſelves and in each other. And indeed, what greater advantages can be derived into our Souls, to make our Altars burn than what our Chriſtian Aſſemblies duly managed will entertain us with?

This Sanctuary Love <hi>is like the beſt wine, going down ſweetly, and cauſing the Lips even of thoſe that are aſleep to ſpeak!</hi> Keep then to theſe Aſſemblies, that you may duly know whom, what, how and why to Love: and how to ſuit your ſelves in ſpirit, ſpeech and practice towards God, your ſelves, and towards each other unto this generous and noble Principle. Thus will you grow exceedingly, both in the knowledge and ſavour of what is moſt conſiderable, and moſt deſervingly affecting, both as to Things and Perſons; for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is contrived for Love and Godlineſs in all its Doctrines, Laws and Ordinances, and in aſſemblies you have the Explications, and Enforcements of thoſe Truths; which will compleat the Man of God, as to his Principles, Diſpoſition and Behaviour. Here you may know your moſt holy Faith as to it's matter, evidences, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon you; and it's improvableneſs by you to it's determined and declared ends and ſervices; That Faith which is to illuminate your Eyes; to exerciſe your thoughts, to fix your holy purpoſes, to form and cheriſh expectations, to raiſe deſires, to embolden prayer, to fire your affections, and regulate them as to their Objects, Ends, and Meaſures, and Expreſſions: And when you there attend, you are in the way of Bleſſings. How oft, and evidently, are Divine Truths, there ſenſibly ſharpened and ſucceeded by the God of Truth? <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 16. <hi>Paul and Barnabas ſo ſpake, as that a Multitude believed of Jews and Gentiles,</hi> Act. xiv. 1. And thither muſt you and I reſort, and there attend for Doctrine, Exhortation, and Inſtruction, in Righteouſneſs.

This is too well ſeen, and known to need its Scriptural Inſtances and Quotations. That which is here intended, I offer in this Paraphraſe. <q>Draw forth all the Spirit and Strength, of what you know, and have adviſedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as to your ſelves and others; of what you have ſeen and heard in your Aſſembling of your ſelves together, concerning your obligations to attend them, their fitneſs to advantage you, and all the benefit derived or deriveable therefrom: Draw forth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of all your received Diſcoveries, Directions, Aſſiſtances and Inducements to do, and be what is required and expected from you,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:155"/> profeſſed by you, and of eternal Conſequence and Concernment to you.</q> Plead this throughly with your ſelves and one another, that ſo your Chriſtian love be not extinguiſht or abated, but wrought and kept up to its genuine and juſt pitch of fervour and effectual Operations and Eruptions in Good works. Drive home upon your ſelves (by deep and ſerious thoughts, and pertinent applications of them to your ſelves, and warm debates about them with your ſelves) the things which God hath manifeſted and propoſed to you as credible, acceptable and practically Improveable. He that expects this flame upon his heart muſt be a thoughtful man, ſeverely contemplative and ſollicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>the things of the Kingdom of God, and the Name and Intereſt, and Servants of the Lord Redeemer.</hi> How can that man be warm and active, or <hi>zealous of Good works,</hi> whoſe knowledge is not actuated by ſelf-awakening Meditations; and whoſe furniture, Principles and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are commonly neglected by himſelf? What! are divine Truths Laws, Promiſes and Inſtitutions only to be with us, or in us, as empty Speculations, or thin Notions? Have Divine Revelations and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearings no Errand to our Hearts and Conſciences, and no buſineſs there, and no practical Vigours to be exerted thence? That thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Idle Souls ſhould be luke-warm is no ſuch wonder or ſtrange thing. The contrary would be ſtranger even to a miracle.

It is <hi>the day;</hi> 2. 'Tis an <hi>approaching day;</hi> and 3. They <hi>ſaw</hi> it thus approaching. 4. The ſight ought (becauſe ſo fit) to quicken them to growthful care and diligence in this heart-warning courſe and work. Whence,</p>

Perhaps the Reader will not loſe his time and labour in peruſing and pauſing upon theſe cited Texts: Nor find them impertinent nor inexpedient as to the caſe in hand. See alſo, ii <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 5-13. How copiouſly and cloſly might all theſe paſſages be inſiſted on, did not the Preſs ſtay for me, and the ſtated confines of a ſhort diſcourſe reſtrain me, and the fruits and labours of abler heads, and better pens, and hearts urge me <hi>ſeverely</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:40119:155"/> becauſe <hi>deſervedly,</hi> to give place thereto? Well, Sirs, Conſider the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching day,</hi> and repreſent it to your thoughtful and concerned ſelves in all its Grandeurs, and Solemnities of Proceſs, and Reſults; and try then if it do not warm your hearts, and urge you pungently, and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Good works. As to the perſons here moſt Immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, theſe Chriſtian Hebrews; There was a day of reckoning with their malignant Enemies by Providential Controverſies and Rebukes, which alſo was a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of great Redemption and Eſtabliſhment to the perſecuted faithful Chriſtians. There was to be a day of great Converſion and divine Atteſtations to the Chriſtian Faith, and to its Proſelytes, and what was more congenial herewith than this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured provocation to love and to good works? And they that are provoked hereto are alſo fitteſt for a day of tryal. But I ſhall here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as the <hi>great day of Chriſts appearance and his Kingdom,</hi> ii Tim. iv. 1.8. i 18. <hi>That day</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Judgment and Perdition</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men.</hi> That day of <hi>Revelation</hi> of God and Chriſt in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick glory, that day of ſearches, ſentence, and full execution and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtments in all the accuracies of governing wiſdom, holineſs and grace. Who can contemplate this, and yet be Cold and Barren? Then, in the glorious ſplendours, ſolemnities, and proceedings of that day ſhall it be evident who, and whoſe Son Chriſt is. What coſt and care he hath been at to bring men to this warm and active courſe and temper, and what an eſtimate he and his Father ſet hereon, by what they then diſpenſe and teſtify by way of <hi>recompence of reward</hi> thereto. Chriſt in his threefold glory, <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 26. God ſending him forth and appearing in him, by him, and for him, as his own dear Son, the Son of ſuch a King, i <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 3-16. Father and Son making ſo vaſt a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Sons of men by everlaſting puniſhments and rewards as they are differently found as to Chriſtian love and practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 6-10. ii <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 9-11. <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 34-46. And all that vaſt Aſſembly and Convention, applauding Gods proceedings and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Congratulating the great endeavours and rewards of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and Succeſsful love. Are not theſe warming thoughts?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Caſe.</p>
            <p>And of this I have given you this textual reſolution. You have ſeen, 1. The <hi>Seat</hi> of this diſtemper, of a <hi>Luke-warm Frame</hi> or <hi>Temper,</hi> that it is in the <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>will.</hi> 2. The <hi>formal nature</hi> of it. 'Tis a <hi>defect</hi> or <hi>chilneſs</hi> of practical love and zeal, to and for God, and their concerns with us, and ours with them. The things which claim and merit the higheſt place in, and that ſhould engage, and exerciſe our beſt affections, and moſt active zeal, are, 1. Gods glory in the Church and World. 2. The life and growth, and the vivid Exerciſes, Profeſſion and Effects of Godlineſs in our ſelves, <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 11.—14. <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 17 — 19. <hi>Jude</hi> 20, 21. ii <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 3.—11. For we muſt begin at home and ſet our all in order there. 3. The Power, Peace, and Progreſs of the Goſpel in the World, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 3.—11. ii. 19.21. That it may have its free courſe and
<pb facs="tcp:40119:156"/> be glorified. 4. The Harmony and Proſperity of the Church of Chriſt wherever this Goſpel is accepted and profeſt. 5. The Caſe and Circumſtances of particular profeſſours as they variouſly are, and are evidently conſiderable, as to their Growth, Tryals, Duties, Dangers, Decays, Wants, or Weakneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. And the Sons of men as <hi>Strangers, Enemies,</hi> Perſecutors, or any ways Endeavouring to ſupplant the Goſpel intereſt, or to obſtruct it or diſcourage it. And theſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as reducible or incorrigible. Now <hi>heartleſsneſs, Neutrality</hi> or <hi>Sluggiſhneſs of our affectionate concernedneſs about theſe things is</hi> what we call <hi>Luke-warmneſs.</hi> 3. The <hi>Cure</hi> hereof doth formally conſiſt in our <hi>Enflamed love,</hi> Exerciſed and Expreſt unto the life by conſtant activity congenial with this principle. The practical accommodating of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency &amp; vigours of this principle of love to the concerns of Chriſtian godlineſs; and of thoſe that are concerned therewith, purſuant to the growth and proſperouſneſs thereof. When we ſo value theſe concerns, &amp; have ſuch Sympathizing with, and ſuch genuine adherence to, reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and activity for, and ſatisfaction in the proſperouſneſs of the things of God, and Chriſt, and Souls, and Chriſtian Churches, as that nothing can ſtand before us, nor be regarded or dreaded by us, that rivals or oppoſes them; then are we indeed effectually cured. Here our thoughts naturally fix; and work, here our hearts cleave and flame; and hereunto our vigors, time, intereſt and treaſures, are moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and cheerfully devoted. Where is there then the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of a <hi>Luke-warm Temper;</hi> When we are wrought up to this Frame and pitch? 4. The way and means of working this great cure, are, 1. Perſons conſidered. 2. Aſſemblies attended on. 3. What <hi>there,</hi> and <hi>thence,</hi> and <hi>otherwiſe</hi> is, or may be derived, improved by Mutual Exhortation. 4. And all this under the powerful influences of, and in fit and full proportion to a quick and conſtant apprehenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and apprehenſion of the approaching day.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing the Text is Hortatory, Directive and Encouraging hereto; and hath <hi>as ſuch</hi> been treated on accordingly, I will wave all further application, and only give you the Directions and Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the curing of a luke-warm temper.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Love-quenching and abating principles Intereſts and Practices are to be exploded and avoided. If once you entertain hard thoughts of God, as if he were moroſe and captious, <hi>a barren Wilderneſs, or Land of darkneſs;</hi> and only careful to ruine and diſtreſs his creatures upon the meer accounts of Soveraignty, and the Prerogative of Dominion, tho a poor penitent lye proſtrate at his feet for mercy, in tears and ſhame and ſelf abhorrence: or in a readineſs to do ſo, were there but any hopes of merciful acceptance: If you ſhall repreſent him to your ſelves, as if he were ſo tenacious of revengeful purpoſes and of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages put into his hands for the full executions of ſuch deſerved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges, through former crimes provoking thereunto; Alas how can you think upon him, or addreſs your ſelves to him with hope and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure!
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40119:156"/> We find grace repreſented to us as Gods Image in his creatures. we find that holineſs in creatures makes them the ſweeteſt of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their diſpoſitions and deportments, and readieſt to be charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abundant in benign, and alluring, and obliging remiſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and diſpenſations. Such are moſt backward to make rigid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and conſtructions of mens miſcarriages and neglects, when they ariſe from rather infirmity than malignity; and from ignorance and ſurprize, than from contrivance or perverſe reſolution. They hate above all men, every thing that ſavours of ſtingineſs and of a ſordid Spirit, and they like not to retain revengeful purpoſes to ruin or diſturb thoſe criminals who ſeriouſly and pathetically implore their pardon, and beg admiſſion to their now much valued favour. And doth grace make ſuch perſons better than their maker; and is that Gods Image in them which hath nothing in God correſpondent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with? Or can we think that the <hi>Image</hi> can exceed its <hi>Grand Exemplar?</hi> Such black and diſmal thoughts of God can never kindle love in us to him. Did I not know and think that <hi>God is love,</hi> how could I ſeek to him in hope, and love him? For my part, I verily believe God ſent his Son into the world, to convince us of his love and goodneſs, and to invite us to himſelf, under the power of this alluring principle of Truth, <hi>That God loves us dearly, and that he will reject no ſinner whoſe heart is touched with ſuch love to him, as makes it reſtleſs and uneaſie in it ſelf, till it obtain his pardon, image, fellowſhip and preſence.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 6. And as for Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>livelieſt Image,</hi> and the <hi>trueſt</hi> and moſt <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mirrour of the Inviſible God,</hi> that ever any Eye beheld, or can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. How ſweet, indulgent, humble, gracious, and endearing, was he unto all? and how ready to receive all that come to God through him? O! do not then miſtake his <hi>grace, deſign,</hi> or <hi>temper.</hi> Love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live and do its work, where Chriſt is not duly repreſented in his lovely Excellencies.</p>
            <p>And yet on the other hand, repreſent not God below himſelf, as fond in his reſpects, partial in his dealings, ſlack and eaſie in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, apt to favour us, tho' neglected by us; as one ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge us in our ſins, and to connive and wink at our miſcarriages; or one that we may trifle with, and fondly think that we can at any time procure his favour, and extinguiſh or evade his anger and diſpleaſure, by ſome trifling applications to him, or flattering Elogies of his name upon the knee, or a copious, verboſe declaiming againſt our ſins and ſelves in our ſtated or occaſional addreſſings of our ſelves to him, when pangs of Death, horrours of Conſcience, or the taſts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of his Wrath make us uneaſie to our ſelves: as if by comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and petty obſervances of God in lower matters, we could turn and toſs a ductile nature into any aſpect, ſhape or poſture that may ſerve our private turns, and pleaſe our arrogant and preſumptuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and court God to ſtrip himſelf of all the glories of his Name and Throne, and proſtitute his Intereſt and Honour, Laws and Majeſty
<pb facs="tcp:40119:157"/> unto the fond conceits of fools and ſinners: for this is blaſphemy and preſumption to the height, both fit and ſure to be puniſht by the Judge. Could God be <hi>Love,</hi> or lovely in the eyes of ſober and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning men, were he thus facile, ſo as to be infuenced by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and humours of ſinners in their dotages? He that would not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie one thought of mercy to our revolted Parents, before he had repreſented himſelf moſt awful in his Judiciary Proceſs, and that ſo guarded both his Laws and Throne with awful Majeſty and Sanctions; and that exacted ſo ſevere a ſatisfaction from his Son; he ſurely nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will, nor can debaſe himſelf, and tempt his creatures by unfit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations of his Laws and Courſes to think him deſpicable, even by ſuch unfit deportments of himſelf towards them. That fool which takes Gods mercies and indulgencies to be at his commands, ſo as to ſin and pray; and that makes ſuch eaſie pardons and redreſſes, the continual encouragements of ſinful practices and hopes; that fool, I ſay again, that is of this perſwaſion and deportment, is no way likely to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his luke-warm temper, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix. 19, 20. For ſo eaſie pardons and redreſſes would evidently and effectually mortifie the Spirit, and defeat the glorious deſigns of Divine Government amongſt men. See <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 25-28, 29. x. 26-31. <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 6-10. <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 7-9. i <hi>Sam.</hi> ii. 2, 3-29, 30 ii <hi>Chron.</hi> xv. 2.</p>
            <p>And if you take your Chriſtianity to be a ſtate of drudgery and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolateneſs; if you degenerate into worldlineſs, luxury or volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, (as in <hi>John</hi> ii. 15-17. <hi>James</hi> iv. 4.) If you grow ſo tender of your ſelves as to be ſwayed more by what affects the <hi>outward</hi> than the <hi>inward</hi> man: If you give way to partiality, to jealouſies, heats and ferments, to a cenſorious, jealous and detracting Spirit; or to the Spirit of domination and diviſion; or if you form your principles, intereſts and actions according to the meaſures and concerns of this vain tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient world, and of the animal life: This malady will prove incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heart-warming objects are to be contemplated. Such as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods name: The Grandeurs of his Majeſty and Throne, the Accuracies of his Government in all its Conſtitutions and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Stores and Treaſures of his Goodneſs with all their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and yet generous diſtributions, unto all his creatures: the riches of his grace in his kindneſs to us by Jeſus Chriſt, the exhibition of his Son and all the amiable excellencies and endearing aſpects and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes made to us by him: the life that is in Chriſt, the grace and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> that are given us by him, ſo great and precious: all the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and intimacies that we are hereby called and admitted to: Goſpel Treaſures and Proviſions to bring and keep our God and us together in order to all the Solaces and Satisfactions of Steady, Full, Eternal Friendſhip: the eminent importance of his Goſpel, Intereſt and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in and to the world, the Church and us; the lovelineſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours of his Intereſt and Image in us, as formed fixt and actuated, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40119:157"/> poſſeſſed by his eternal Spirit, to his eternal praiſe by Jeſus Chriſt: the ſolid pleaſures, peace and uſefulneſs of regular zeal for God, Chriſt, Chriſtianity and all that are near and dear to God, with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and renown which this well fixt and ordered zeal prepares us for. All that we are ſaved from, by, to, through the effectual cure of this diſeaſe. All the ſolemnities of Chriſts approaching day; and our great concerns therein. All the good that is in, that attends upon, and that iſſues from the proſperous Succeſſes of the Goſpel, the holineſs and and peace of the Church, and the health, the uſefulneſs, the poſſeſſion, the Conflicts and Conqueſts of a well cured Soul, and all the Honours, Eaſe and Bleſſings that attend our glorious Goſpel. All this, and much more deſerves deep thoughts, and all the fervours and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Services of love. And the plain truth is this: We are both conſtituted of, and ſurrounded with enflaming objects of this love. And the great object and attractive ſhines even moſt gloriouſly in all. Nature in all its Harmonies, Stores and Beauties; Providence in all its illuſtrations of its excellencies and exactneſs, ſuiting it ſelf in all the Articles thereof to every thing and being and concern in Heaven and Earth. The ſacred Scriptures every way entertaining us with what may exerciſe and enrich the mind of man, heal and compoſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, enthroning it as Gods vicegerent to inſpect the principles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and practices, and State of men, to make and keep them orderly, ſafe and eaſy, and <hi>ſo</hi> to affect the heart and life, <hi>as that</hi> we may be lovely in the ſight of God, the bleſſings of our Stations in our genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and a moſt comfortable entertainment to our ſelves. <hi>Our very ſelves</hi> are moſt provoking objects unto love. So many faculties in our Souls! So many paſſions and affections to be ordered and exerciſed aright! So many ſences for reception! So many Organs and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the commodious promoting and ſecuring of our own Good! So many Objects, Employments and Acqueſts to be engaged vigorouſly about and orderly converſant with all continually! And God in all this eminently beaming forth thoſe perfections which are ſo fit and worthy to take endearingly with us! How inexcuſeable is cold heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs whenas it may ſo eaſily be cured by ſerious Contemplations of theſe objects! Light and Colours, and beautiful proportions to the eye: Words and Melodies to the Ears: Food to the taſt, and all the objects, exerciſes and entertainments of every ſenſe, afford our very minds and hearts their delicacies to feed on, and urge us to love God and Man.</p>
            <p>And let me add this alſo, the beauties and delightfulneſs of holineſs and practical Religion as exemplified in holy perſons, <hi>thoſe excellent ones in whom is my delight.</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> xvi. 3. O to obſerve them in all their curious imitations and reſemblances of their God, in the Wiſdom of their Conduct, the fervours of their Spirits, the ſteadineſs of their purpoſes, the evenneſs of their tempers, the uſefulneſs and blameleſsneſs of their lives, the loftineſs of their aims, the placed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb facs="tcp:40119:158"/> of their Looks, the ſavour and obligingneſs of their Speeches, the generous largeneſs of their Hearts, the openneſs of their Hands, the impartiality of their Thoughts, the tenderneſs of their Bowels, and all the ſweetneſſes of their Deportments towards all. Such things are really, where Chriſtian Godlineſs obtains indeed. Tho meer pretenders, or real Chriſtians in their decays and ſwoons, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Religion under its eclipſes to it's great diſadvantage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. When therefore we contemplate all theſe excellencies, (and many more not mentioned) will not our Hearts take fire and burn with love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> where theſe things are <hi>viſible;</hi> and with the Love of <hi>benevolence,</hi> and <hi>beneficence</hi> to <hi>that</hi> degree, towards thoſe that are receptive of, but want them, <hi>which</hi> ſhall enrage Deſires, and Prayers, and quicken us to diligent endeavours after what by ſuch may be attained unto, were they but cloſely and warmly followed by us, and brought to the diligent purſuits thereof.

            <p n="3">3. Heart-awakening and Love-quickning Truths are to be duly and intimately conſidered. And this is indeed in part, to <hi>truthifie in Love,</hi> if I may make an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word to expreſs the valor of the <hi>Greek</hi> Word, <gap reason="foreign">

No exact ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Spirits, no ſafety in our State, no real eaſe and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Souls, no evidence of our acceptance with our God, no Duty well performed towards God or Man, no Sins ſubdued, no Trial bravely managed and reſulted, no Talents uſed fully to the Maſters Satisfaction and Advantage; nothing profeſt, performed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured or obtained without this Love. And according to it's Ebbs and Flows, it's Inflammations and Abatements, ſo doth it fare and go with all our Chriſtianity and Concerns. The Truth is, all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of Souls and Perſons, in Life, Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell, are hereupon depending. Theſe Articles of Truth conſidered well, will make us ſerious, fervent, reſolute and induſtrious in the things of God.</p>

Pray hard, read frequently and ſeriouſly, hear diligently and impartially; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate cloſely and concernedly upon all you read or hear relating to the great concern. Be much in Chriſtian conference, in the due Spirit, and to the genuine deſign and purpoſes thereof; be much in Praiſe,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40119:158"/> Thanks, Self-obſervation, Government and Diſcipline: Look up to Heaven for help, and improve faithfully what you thence obtain. And I do take the Supreme, Eſſentially, Infinite Good, to be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and degraded by us in our Thoughts and Walk; if any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Intereſts or Excellencies do ultimately terminate our Affections and Intentions.

How often have the delicate compoſures of grave and ſprightly Muſick well managed by the ſweet and skilful Voice or touch, provoked and urged my Soul to admire the chief good, and the Eternal ſource of all communicated and communicable ingenuity and expertneſs in that, and in all ſorts of Arts and Sciences!

Of all other the Chriſtian Religion, which we own and profeſs, is the beſt and moſt worthy of our engaging in and immoveable cleaving to, <hi>being pure and undefiled before God and the Father,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.27. <hi>v.</hi> Unſpeakably profitable it is and advantageous to the Kingdoms that receive it, and to the Perſons who are ſincere in it, and ſtudious of conforming themſelves to its holy Precepts and Rules. The ſacred Scriptures drawn up and left by men divinely inſpired and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſiſted, from which alone we fetch it, (not from Fathers or Councils, whatever eſteem and Veneration we have for them,) do commend themſelves unto the judgments and conſciences of men, who have not ſhaken hands with reaſon, and fetch ſo great a compaſs as to contain and reveal, either in particular or general directions, all that which is neceſſary for us to believe or do in order to our full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and endleſs felicity in the next world, and our preſent ſafety, peace and comfort in this fooliſh and troubleſome one. <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. <hi>The Commandment is exceeding broad.</hi> It is <hi>long</hi> for its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, being <hi>aeternae veritatis,</hi> of everlaſting truth, not any thing ſhall be diminiſhed or cut off from it, not any thing ſhall be chang'd or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in it, and it is <hi>broad</hi> for its uſefulneſs, extending to and ſpreading it ſelf over all the occaſions of men, for it hath comforts Sovereign and proper in all diſtreſſes though never ſo pinching, together with
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40119:160"/> directions adapted to and fitted for all conditions and affairs, though never ſo difficult and abſtruſe.</p>
            <p>The bleſſed Word of God will teach you how to order and demean your ſelves in your perſonal capacities, and in your relative too; how to walk alone, and how to draw in the Yoke. It preſents us with the beſt Ethicks, Oeconomicks, and Politicks in the World: <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> and <hi>Machiavels</hi> are fooleries if compared with it. This precious word being well attended to and obeyed, will make comfortable Families, flouriſhing Kingdoms and States. Oh that all thoſe unto whom the Lord hath in his goodneſs vouchſafed theſe Oracles would be ſo wiſe as to make them <hi>their delight and Counſellors.</hi> Sure I am we ſhould then be bleſſed with better Husbands and Wives, better Parents and Children, better Maſters and Servants, better Friends and Neighbours, better Miniſters and people, better Magiſtrates and Subjects. <hi>The beauty of the Lord our God would be upon us,</hi> and that would make our faces ſhine.</p>
            <p>Of the laſt mention'd Relation, <hi>viz.</hi> That between Magiſtrates and Subjects, the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> treats at the beginning of this Chapter, and ſo on to the 8th verſe. In the firſt verſe he iſſueth out his precept, from which it appears that Chriſt is no enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſtian Religion not inconſiſtent with thoſe of Loyalty. The beſt Chriſtians will be found (at long run to be ſure) the beſt Subjects. None ſo true to their Prince as thoſe that are moſt faithful to their God, for what ſaith our Apoſtle? <hi>Let every Soul be Subject to the higher powers.</hi> Every one, Man, Woman, and Child, that is capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what ſubjection means, and of expreſſing it. Be he of what rank and in what ſtation he will, high or low, noble or baſe, rich or poor, of the Clergy (by the Popes leave) or of the Laity, as ſome love to ſpeak, let him be Subject, not overtop, not exalt himſelf over that which is called God, but be ſubject to the higher powers. Who are they? the Civil Magiſtrates. Antichriſt hath put in his claim here, but he is juſtly non-ſuited by Proteſtants. It is the Civil Magiſtrate, whoſe intereſt and right our Apoſtle here aſſerts and pleads: Kings, as he ſpeaks in another Epiſtle, and all that are in Authority. Theſe we are to pray for, to theſe we ought to be Subject, to theſe we muſt pay tribute, theſe we muſt honour, ſupport and aſſiſt, theſe we are bound to obey, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake, and that in all things in which obedience to them doth not carry in the bowels of it diſobedience unto God, whom the greateſt and higheſt of them are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely below. This precept he backs and binds upon Chriſtians with ſundry arguments drawn,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Inſtitution. Of Magiſtracy of what kind ſoever the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be, whether Monarchical, or Ariſtocratical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Still Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is of divine Inſtitution. It is Gods Ordinance and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>There is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God.</hi> It is not of the Devil, who is an enemy to order, and delights in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:161"/> nor is it only by the will of man, whatſoever they may and do contribute toward it, nor is it ony of thoſe who poſſeſs the Throne and ſway the Scepter; but it is of God who in his infinite wiſdom and goodneſs to mankind, hath determined and ordered it ſhould be ſo, who according to the pleaſure of his will, without giving account of his matters, putteth down one, and ſetteth up another, and who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſuch an inſtinct and principle into men living together in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity as powerfully and effectually leads to the electing of one or more, and ſetting him or them over them, arming and intruſting them with power and authority, for the adminiſtration of juſtice and publick affairs, that by them common ſafety and good may be both ſecured and promoted, and from them as from the head, vital and comfortable influences may be conveyed to the whole politick body, yea to the meaneſt and loweſt of its members who grind at the Mill and handle the Diffaff.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the ſin of thoſe who refuſe this required Subjection, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſiſt the Magiſtrate, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God.</hi> He doth herein run counter and Croſs to the all-wiſe God, and his declared will. He doth as it were, ſet his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Will againſt Gods. <hi>Bellum cum Deo ſuſcipit,</hi> whatever he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to himſelf, he undertakes and wages War with God. This man ſinneth againſt God as well as againſt man, is a Rebel againſt the Majeſty of Heaven as well as his Prince upon earth refuſing the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience he ows to his Ordinance and Command.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the evil and fatal conſequence or effect of Rebellion and Reſiſtance, of which in the ſame verſe, <hi>they that reſiſt ſhall receive unto themſelves damnation.</hi> They commit ſuch a crime as ſhall moſt certainly and ſeverely be revenged, they had better never have done it, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will ſurely follow it, and it may be with a quick and ſpeedy pace, either from the hand of the Magiſtrate, to whom the Sword is committed, with which he is to animadvert upon all diſobedience, or by the hand of God who will plead the cauſe and vindicate the honour of his Lieutenants and Vicegerents; ſo that ſuch Delinquents are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſafe, but in danger of a <hi>Temporal</hi> puniſhment here, as <hi>Korah</hi> and his accomplices experienced, and ſo did that unnatural wretch <hi>Abſalom;</hi> or an <hi>eternal</hi> one in Hell in caſe hearty repentance do not by an happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſal prevent it.</p>

The Queſtion, which I am deſired to ſpeak unto being this:</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the duty of Magiſtrates from the higheſt to the loweſt, for the ſuppreſſing of prophaneneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling hereof I ſhall obſerve this method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Enquire what is meant by prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is intended by the ſuppreſſion of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Prove it to be the duty of all Magiſtrates to imploy their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power for that great and excellent end.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Propound and offer ſundry means which they may and ſhould make uſe of in order thereunto.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Shut up our whole diſcourſe with application; and the great God aſſiſt in the work, and bleſs that which ſhall be done. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our firſt enquiry then will be, what are we to underſtand by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs.</hi> In anſwer whereunto we will conſider the word, which in Latin is <hi>prophanus,</hi> and as ſome learned Criticks obſerve, is as much as <hi>procul à Fano,</hi> far from the Temple or holy place, far from God; that which is far from the mind and will of God, that which God doth not approve, will have nothing to do with, which ſpeaks thoſe that love and practiſe it a company of perſons at a diſtance from God. The word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now ſaith <hi>Aretius,</hi>

               </gap> ſignifieth pure, ſuch a purity as is in the ſtars of Heaven, or a ſerene Sky, and the ſyllable <hi>Be</hi> doth change the ſignification and import of the word, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we do well underſtand by it that which is unclean, impure, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, filthy. So that prophaneneſs is uncleanneſs, of which there are two ſorts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Ceremonial uncleanneſs. Thus we read of defiled hands and common meats. Of the former, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.2. <hi>There came together unto him certain of the Phariſees and Scribes, and when they ſaw ſome of his Diſciples, eat Bread with defiled (that is to ſay, with unwaſhen hands) they found fault.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with common hands, impure ones. That was counted by them a profane action, which polluted the perſon that did it, and ſo you read of common meats, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>Peter ſaw Heaven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:162"/> and a certain Veſſel deſcending unto him, as it had been a great ſheet, wherein were all manner of four-footed Beaſts of the Earth, and Wild Beaſts, and Creeping things, and Fouls of the Air; and there came a voice to him, Riſe,</hi> Peter, <hi>Kill and Eat; but</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid, Not ſo, Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. There common is oppoſed to holy; it was a thing not fit for that holy people whom God had called out from the reſt of the world &amp; made his own peculiar. That was common, unclean or prophane, which was lawful to the Gentiles, but prohibited the Jews by the Ceremonial Law; as to inſtance Swines fleſh. That Law is now aboliſhed; with this ſort of uncleanneſs we at preſent have nothing to do, as not being intended in the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a moral uncleanneſs, and that is it here meant. That is ſaid to be profane, which is impure, polluted, foul, loathſome and defiling; and ſo it may be, and, as we find in Scripture, it is applied both to perſons and to things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To perſons. Thus in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.25. when the <hi>Lord</hi> by the Prophet ſpake to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> it was in this language: <hi>Thou prophane, wicked Prince of</hi> Iſrael. His prophaneneſs did ariſe from, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in his wickedneſs, for he had grievouſly polluted himſelf with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Perjury, with curſed perſecutions and the blood of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. He was both a ſtranger and enemy to all piety, and purity, he ingulph'd himſelf in wickedneſs, and laboured with all his might to draw others of his Subjects, both noble and baſe into the ſame practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to Plunge them as deep as himſelf. <hi>Eſau</hi> hath the ſame brand ſet upon him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Leſt there be any fornicator or prophane perſon, as</hi> Eſau, <hi>who for one morſel of meat ſold his Birth-right.</hi> A prophane perſon, <hi>qui nihil habet ſacri,</hi> who hath in him nothing Sacred, nothing of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who violates, neglects, tramples under foot holy things; who ſo pleaſeth himſelf in filthineſs as to wallow in it; in whom the love of the world is ſo predominant, &amp; to pleaſures, riches and honours he is ſo addicted, that he prefers them before the grace of God, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in himſelf and in the world. Such an one as valued car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things above ſpiritual, earthly above heavenly and a ſmall fleſhly enjoyment above ſo great and advantageous a priviledge as the Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Prophaneneſs is attributed to things. Thus in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Refuſe prophane and old Wives Fables,</hi> by which we are, according to learned men, to underſtand, either the abſurd Jewiſh ſtories, or ſome ſuperſtitious perſons forbidding to marry, and the uſe of ſundry ſorts of meats; or thoſe idle and fooliſh Doctrines which place the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in ſuch low and pittiful things as external ſapleſs Rites, and Ceremonies, Forms, Modes and Geſtures. But further thoſe things are plainly and notoriouſly prophane which are ſinful and wicked. Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery is prophaneneſs in Grain; a wicked life is a prophane life. To Lye, and Swear, and Curſe, and Whore are acts of prophaneneſs; for people to drive on their worldly Trades, to buy and ſell, in Houſes, Shops, or
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40119:162"/> Streets upon the Sabbath-day are acts of prophaneneſs. This is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of that day which God hath ſeparated from the reſt of the days, and ſanctified and ſet apart for holy uſe, his own worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the good of Souls. In ſhort, all that which is contrary to the Divine Law, thoſe excellent and bleſſed Rules which God hath been pleaſed in his Word to give out unto us, for the right management of our ſelves, and ordering of our Lives and Converſations in the World; all that, I ſay, is prophaneneſs, whether it be <hi>Impiety</hi> or <hi>Immorality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſecond work is to enquire what we are to underſtand by the ſuppreſſing of prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer in general; the ſuppreſſing of it doth ſignify the keeping of it under. If prophaneneſs be not carefully look'd to, but let alone, it will quickly grow to an head, and ſoon over-ſpread and over-top all. It muſt therefore be kept down, and if through the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of ſome, and the impudence of others it be got to an height, it muſt be knockt down. Such tough humours in the body Politick need and call for ſtrong Purges, and Civil Magiſtrates, who are the State-Phyſicians cannot be better imployed than about ſuch works as that. More particularly, I ſhall mention two things, which the ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſs doth carry in it.</p>
            <p>A prevention of
<list>
                  <item>1. The acts of prophaneneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. The growth of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, There muſt be a prevention of the Acts of prophaneneſs. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane principles in the heart of a man, lying ſtill, and as it were, dormant, not breaking forth, are out of the reach of others; Neither the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Sword, be it never ſo long, nor the Miniſters Word, if alone and unaccompanied with the Divine Spirit, can reach it, or prevail againſt it. That is the mighty and glorious work of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who alone knoweth the Heart and ſearcheth it, and can change, alter and mend it. None but he that made the heart at firſt, can mould it anew: None but he can caſt Salt into that Spring, none but he can graft ſuch holy principles as to make a corrupt tree good. But wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane practices in the lives, of men as are the wretched products, fruits and iſſues of baſe and curſed principles, may be curb'd, reſtrain'd and prevented: So that though the wickedneſs of the wicked will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, yet it ſhall not be committed with that frequency and boldneſs, and openneſs as it hath been, and to this very day is. With ſhame and ſorrow be it ſpoken. In the <hi>Heb:</hi> 12.15. <hi>Look diligently, leſt any man fail of the Grace of God, leſt any root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you.</hi> You may underſtand it both of unſound doctrine &amp; abominable practices, but I am now only to deal with the latter. Sin, luſt, corruption in the heart is a root of bitterneſs, yielding that which is bitter to God; his Soul hates and abhors it: And it is bitter to man in the ſad direful conſequences and effects of it, which when the fooliſh ſelf-humouring ſinner comes to taſt he will certainly find worſe than Gall. Sin is his dainties, he rolls it as a delicious morſel under his tongue, but it will prove the poiſon
<pb facs="tcp:40119:163"/> of Aſpes within him. Now it nearly concerns every one to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the pulling up of this root in his own heart, let him ſet both his hands to the work, let him lay the axe to it, and call God in to his aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is ten thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thouſand times more deſireable to have in you that root of the matter which holy <hi>Job</hi> ſpake of, than to have this root of bitterneſs in you. But then it ought to be the care of all, ſpecially Governours, both in Families, Churches, Kingdoms and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſhould look diligently to it, that this root do not <hi>pullulare,</hi> ſpring up; if at any time it begins to peep and ſhew its head, oppoſe it with might and main, trample upon it with the foot of juſt indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never ſuffer it to ſhoot up, bud and bring forth. Though men will not be ſo good as they ſhould, do not give them leave to be as bad as they would: It is not in your power to dry up the fountain, but it is a part of your duty to dam up the ſtreams; and though you cannot era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate mens vitious habits yet you muſt reſtrain their outward acts, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1.20. <hi>Of whom are</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander, <hi>whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaſpheme.</hi> A ſtrange way of cure, to prevent ſin by giving men up to the Devil, yet ſuch as God preſcrib'd and proſper'd. After the ſame manner, let flagitious Perſons be delivered up to puniſhment, that ſo though they will not, <hi>virtutis amore,</hi> for the love of virtue, yet <hi>formidine poenae,</hi> for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they may learn to bridle themſelves, and not to do any more ſo wickedly as they have done. One great end of puniſhment being the reclaiming and amending the offender if he be not paſt hope.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There muſt be a ſuppreſſion of the growth and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of prophaneneſs. I ſhall hereafter ſhew you a little more fully, how that ſin is like ſome unhappy weeds, that if once they get into a ground, and be not timely dealt with, will in a little while run far and near, and overſpread the whole, they do not need any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is enough for them to be let alone. Of all Weeds this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the worſt and moſt diffuſive of itſelf; a prophane wretch is like one that hath the plague, he is indeed a peſt, or common plague in the place where he is, his very breath and touch, his diſcourſes, and actions are infectious, he goeth up and down tainting thoſe with whom he doth converſe, who are not of healthful conſtitutions of Souls, and well antidoted with the fear and awe of God. And this was one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives in the forementioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. why he would have ſuch ſpecial care taken to prevent the ſpringing up of any root of bitterneſs, <hi>leſt thereby</hi> many be defiled, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, polluted, beſpattered, made as filthy and naſty as the beaſts themſelves. If ſuch a root of bitterneſs be ſuffered to ſpring up, many will be troubled at it, and many will be defiled by it. It is the deſign and delight of wicked men to make others as bad as themſelves, and to draw both Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Strangers to caſt in their lot among them, and to walk hand in-hand with them in their crooked ways that lead down to the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40119:163"/> Chambers of Death. Oh that the Saints and People of God were as deſirous and induſtrious for the promoting of true Piety, as the Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Hell are for the propagating of prophaneneſs! Oh that they would be as diligent to perſwade men and women into the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel, as theſe are to make deviliſh Proſelytes! In a Word, that they would take as much care and pains for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others along with them to Heaven, as theſe are to allure and hurry others to Hell. But to our ſhame be it ſpoken, we are too dull, heavy and unactive, we are greatly out-done by them; we are not a quarter ſo zealous for the reſcuing of poor Sinners out of the clutches of the deſtroyer, as they are for the bringing them under his power.</p>
            <p>But ſure I am, it is the Duty of all, ſpecially the concernment of thoſe, who are by God inveſted with Power, to reckon it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to mind it as a very conſiderable part of their work, to look to it, that this noiſom Plague be ſtay'd. And to that purpoſe, I deſire them to conſider what was the Reſolution of <hi>David</hi> the man after <hi>Gods</hi> own Heart, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101.8. <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the Land;</hi> it ſhould be one of the firſt things he did, to deſtroy them, not corporally by taking away their Lives, but civilly by a due and ſtrict Diſcipline, and ſo <hi>cut off all evil doers from the City of the Lord.</hi> Where this is not attended to, ſad and doleful experience hath made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the World, that Hell will immediately break looſe, the Flood-gates of Wickedneſs will be all drawn up, and an inundation of the blackeſt villanies will follow and drown a Land, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.6. <hi>In thoſe days there was no King in Iſrael.</hi> None that could Effectually hinder Idolatry or any thing elſe, none that had a ſufficient coercive Power, for the Judges did deal with the People rather by Counſel and Perſwaſion than by Commands and Puniſhments; and then ſaith the Text, <hi>Every man did that which was right in his own Eyes,</hi> and you need not doubt but a great deal of that was wrong and odious in Gods Eyes.</p>
            <p>But Magiſtrates by their Diligence in their places, acting up to their truſt, and a due Execution of Juſtice may ſecure our Banks, and ſet up a ſtandard againſt wickedneſs even then when it cometh in upon us ſwelling and roaring like a Flood. <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.6. &amp;c. made this Law, That if any one ſhould offer to tempt another to Idolatry, though the Perſon doing it were his <hi>Brother, the Son of</hi> his <hi>Mother, or</hi> his <hi>Son or</hi> his <hi>Daughter, or the Wife of</hi> his <hi>Boſom, or a Friend, that was as</hi> his <hi>own Soul,</hi> let him be never ſo near, and never ſo dear, yet if He ſhould ſay, <hi>Let us go and ſerve other Gods,</hi> His Friend and moſt intimate Relation being thus tempted, ſhould ſurely kill him, his hand ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> upon him, and afterward the hand of all the people, and they ſhould ſtone him with ſtones till he died. And now obſerve what was the end and deſign hereof. You have it ſet down in <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>All Iſrael ſhall hear and fear, and ſhall do no more any ſuch wickedneſs as this is among you.</hi> This will be <hi>in terrorem,</hi> it will
<pb facs="tcp:40119:164"/> ſcare and fright the wretches, ſuch an Act of Juſtice will ring and grow famous, it will be talkt of both in Town and Countrey, and whereſoever the report comes it will ſtrike an awe upon men, ſo that they ſhall not add to do the like.</p>
            <p>The third thing which, according to the Method I propounded, I have to do, is to make it plain and evident, that it is the indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty of Magiſtrates from the higheſt to the loweſt, to mind the Suppreſſion of prophaneneſs as their buſineſs. For when I do in this caſe ſpeak of Magiſtrates, we are to underſtand it in the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, of Kings and all that are in Authority. All of them, one and other, who have the Sword of Juſtice put into their hands, muſt not drouze and loiter, nor ſuffer that Sword to lie ruſting in the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, but are obliged to draw it, and run it to the very hilts into the Bowels of prophaneneſs. This I ſhall endeavour to prove unto you by ſundry particulars. Though I have looked upon a Sermon of this Nature as more fit for another Auditory, than this which conſiſts of private Perſons; only my thoughts have been, that what in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did not reach ſome mens ears, may in the Print come to their view, and if there were, as peradventure there were, any inferiour Officers preſent, they might conſider what was deliver'd, and carry it home with them, and be thereby excited to their Duty, and do much towards the filling up of their places. But we proceed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Magiſtrates are Gods Vicegerents, his Repreſentatives, they ſtand in his place. As God teacheth by Miniſters, ſo he rules by Magiſtrates, not that he needs either the one or the other, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to make uſe of both. He that at firſt, as the great Creator of the World, inſtamped upon man that Image of his which conſiſts in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, hath ſince the fall, as the wiſe Governour of the World, impreſt upon Princes and Rulers that Image of his which conſiſts in Honour, Authority and Power. This is plain from the Names and Titles given them. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Miniſters, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God unto thee.</hi> A Miniſter of Gods chooſing, a Miniſter of Gods appointing and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; it was God that ſeated him in the Throne, that committed to him the Truſt, that gave him his Office, and put the Power in his hand. And ſaith <hi>Paul, He is a Miniſter of God for good.</hi> That is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pareus,</hi> 1. For natural good to preſerve mens Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties. 2. For moral good, to keep men from vice and flagitious ſelf-ruining courſes. 3. For civil good, to hold up So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and to promote Righteouſneſs and Honeſty. 4. For ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good, to eſtabliſh and uphold the true Religion, and pure worſhip of God. So that they are appointed for a great deal of good, all which you may comfortably expect, and with ſome good confidence Promiſe to your ſelves, whenſoever you ſee good men in the place of Magiſtracy. Brambles will rend and tear, fire will go out of them to devour, but the fruit of the Vine is chearing, and with delight we may ſit under it's comfortable ſhadow.</p>
            <pb n="341" facs="tcp:40119:164"/>
            <p>Yea they are not only called the Miniſters of God, but becauſe they are in ſo great place, and ſet about ſo good work, God hath been pleaſed to put upon them his own Name, as we find in ſundry places of Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods, nor curſe the Ruler of thy People.</hi> Where the latter Expreſſion, <hi>the Ruler of thy People,</hi> Is Exegetical and Explanative of the former, <hi>the Gods;</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tranſlation renders it, <hi>the Judges.</hi> So again, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.1. <hi>God ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty, and judgeth among the Gods.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. By which ſome indeed underſtand the <hi>Angels,</hi> as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.13. When the Witch had raiſed up the <hi>Devil,</hi> a fallen <hi>Angel,</hi> in the ſhape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſhe ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> I ſaw Gods aſcending out of the Earth. And ſo <hi>Pſalm</hi> 86.8. <hi>Among the Gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord.</hi> Though the holy Angels are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures, excellent in Wiſdom, and mighty in Strength, yet among that innumerable company not one can be found like God. But others better underſtand hereby, Princes, Judges, and civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. And not only <hi>David</hi> a good man, a King, called them by this Name, but <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf hath given it them, he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to honour them with this Name, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are Gods, and all of you are the Children of the moſt High.</hi> You are my Commiſſioners, you do <hi>Locum tenere,</hi> hold my place with my leave, and by my appointment. Your Throne is the Throne of God, and your Tribunal the Tribunal of God. I have given you an inviolable Authority, take heed how you uſe it. I have made it your work to do Juſtice, and to diſtribute Rewards and Puniſhments, ſee that you do it. Now what ſhall we infer from hence? Certainly thus much; That Magiſtrates being Gods Vicegerents, they ought to Act like him, and according to his will. Having their Commiſſion from him, they ſhould ſtudy it and conform to it; bearing his <hi>Name,</hi> they ſhould be expreſſive of his <hi>Nature.</hi> Being cloathed with his Power, they ought to imploy it for his Honour, and the promoting of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and againſt his Enemies, of whom Sin is the worſt; for men are ſaid to be <hi>Enemies in their Minds through wicked works.</hi> Are they <hi>Children of the moſt High?</hi> And as ſuch admitted to a part of his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Power? Then it becomes them to be followers of him as dear Children, and as well as they can to imitate him in the diſcharge of that truſt which they have received from him, <hi>Who is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him; the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight, for he hateth all the workers of Iniquity,</hi> Pſalm 5.4, 5. But let us purſue this a little further.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have ſeen what is the place of Magiſtrates, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high and honourable, but not ſupreme, there is one in Heaven that is higher than they, great men in Authority, are ſtill, as the good <hi>Centurion</hi> ſaid, under Authority. Their place is a Vicegerency. Now let us, but ſpecially let them conſider and remember what is the <hi>work and buſineſs of their place.</hi> For that they ought to do, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb facs="tcp:40119:165"/> to ſtand compleat in all the Will of God, as Men, as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and as Magiſtrates, or Men in Office. It will by no means be found enough for men to hold ſuch or ſuch a place in Church or State, but it ought to be their deſire and endeavour to fill up the place they hold. Which if men would ſeriouſly think upon, there would not be that ſeeking of and hunting after places as there generally is. Places then would rather ſeek men than men Places. And as Perſons in Authority and Power do, and will, and juſtly may expect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that honour, revenue and ſalary which doth of right belong to them upon the account of their place: The Prince will not part with his Crown, Scepter and Throne ſo long as He can hold them: Nor the Lord Mayor with his Sword and Mace, no nor the Conſtable with his Staff which is the badge of his Office: So they and all others ought to fill up, as I ſaid, their places with the performance of that Duty which is inſeparably annexed to them. A man had a great deal better never have been advanced to a place of truſt, than to be careleſs, negligent, and remiſs in it. He that ſo advanced is not a publick good is no better than a common nuſance. <hi>Honos</hi> and <hi>Onus,</hi> go together, Honour and Burden; and He doth not deſerve to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Honour, who is not willing to take up the Burden. Well, theſe places carry great work along with them, and that work muſt be done.</p>
            <p>Now if the Queſtion be, What is that work to the doing whereof Magiſtrates are by their places obliged? I anſwer, To appear for God, and to act for God. As God is the Author of their Power, ſo his Intereſt and Honour ought to be the matter of their deſigns, and the end of their Government. This that good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> did full well underſtand, accordingly when he had ſet Judges in the Land, through all the fenced Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> City by City, he ſpake thus unto them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye rule not for men, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgment.</hi> An excellent ſpeech it was, a charge fit to be given to Judges, when to go their Circuits. Judges, yea and others too as well as they, had need be very Cautious and Wary men, exceeding prudent and circumſpect, it concerns them to ponder and weigh actions, how they carry, what Laws they make, how they execute them, what Judgments they give, and what Sentences they paſs. But what is the reaſon hereof? Becauſe they Judge not for men, but for the Lord, and ſo they rule not for men, but the Lord; and when they meet in Parliament they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not for men, but for the Lord. Though indeed they do manage all moſt prudently for men, when they act moſt faithfully for the Lord. And it is certain, it is not Officers own advancement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richment, not their own Honour and Grandeur at which they ſhould level and direct their Actions, none of theſe is the end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of their being called to any part or ſhare of it, but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and his Glory as Supreme, and the good of men as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40119:165"/> And let not that be forgotten which <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> added, <hi>The Lord is with you in the Judgment.</hi> When you do well, and act according to the Law of Righteouſneſs, God is with you to own you, to juſtifie you, to ſtand by you, to comfort and encourage you, to protect and defend you, to reward and bleſs you, as Perſons that have been faithful. And you may be ſure, He is at all times with you, in the Throne, and in the Senate, and upon the Bench, and elſewhere, curiouſly to obſerve, and take notice of that which you do, for <hi>by him actions are weighed.</hi> Magiſtrates and Officers of all ſorts have many eyes upon them, more ſee them than they themſelves ſee. There are upon them the eyes of good men and bad, of Friends and Foes, of Subjects and Strangers: And they have upon them one eye more than, as I fear, ſome of them think of ſo much as they ſhould, and that is the Eye of the great and moſt Holy God. He ſees what is done upon the Throne, and at the Council-board, what in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſes, and what in the Courts of Judicature, what Bills are drawn, and what do obtain the Royal Aſſent, what Laws are enacted, and how they are executed.</p>
            <p>Now that the Puniſhment of Vice and Suppreſſion of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a ſpecial part of the work and duty of their place, is evident from this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> Let the man be what and who he will, let him be cloathed with what circumſtances he will, let him make what Figure he will, if he will do evil he muſt ſuffer for the evil that he doth. If men will take a lawleſs Liberty, the Ruler muſt take vengeance, if they will do the evil of Sin, He muſt ſee to it that they ſuffer the evil of Puniſhment. This is the work of his Office, He is the Miniſter of God for this purpoſe, being <hi>ultor irae divinae,</hi> and having a vial of wrath put into his hand by the Soveraign Lord of Heaven and Earth, which he is to open and pour out upon the Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, who are, for their being ſuch, meritoriouſly <hi>filii irae,</hi> the Children of wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Prophaneneſs is of that curſed Nature and Tendency, that it is not to be tolerated, being contrary to the Light and Law of Nature, and therefore hath been condemned and puniſhed among Heathen Nations, ſpecially ſuch of them as have been civilized, and made any improvement of thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, common Notions, and Principles that had been impreſſed upon their Souls, and took any care to demean and carry themſelves according to the ducture and guidance of them. How much more contrary is it to the greater and more excellent Light of Scripture and Goſpel-revelation, which God hath cauſed to ſo eminent a degree to ſhine among us, and which doth ſo expreſly and abundantly condemn, and denounce the Wrath of God againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men? Who can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently tell how odious it is to Perſons who are moraliz'd, and yet more to all them who have been ſavingly englightned, and had their
<pb facs="tcp:40119:166"/> blindneſs cured by ſome of Chriſts eye-ſalve? And by conſequence how greatly ought it to be abhorr'd, and totally abandon'd in all thoſe Places, Countreys and Nations, unto whom God hath ſent the <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia legis,</hi> the great things of his Law, and alſo the precious things of the Everlaſting Goſpel; what Agreement is there, what Concord between Light and Darkneſs, between Righteouſneſs and Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or what Communion hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> Without all peradventure this is a Work of Darkneſs, and that is not a fit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for them that dwell in a Land of Light. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>The giving of themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſs to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs,</hi> is ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, as the work of thoſe <hi>who have their underſtandings darkened, and are alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them becauſe of the blindneſs of their Hearts;</hi> and altogether indecorous and unbecoming them who have <hi>learned Chriſt,</hi> and been trained up in the Goſpel-School. Shall then ſuch things be winked at, allowed, or countenanced in a Valley of Viſion? No, no, ſay I, for as theſe are the ſins, ſo they are the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and ſhame both of thoſe that do them, and of thoſe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them. As Goſpel Truths and Ordinances and the ordering of a Converſation aright in ſuitableneſs to them, are (as the dying Wife of <hi>Phineas</hi> ſaid of the Ark) <hi>the Glory of Iſrael,</hi> ſo Immorality is it's diſgrace. Both theſe we are aſſured of by <hi>Solomon</hi> in one verſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a reproach to any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> The common opinion of men is, that the Exaltation of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from the prudence of it's Prince, the wiſdom of it's Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the valour of it's Commanders and Souldiers, the ſucceſs of it's Armies, victory over it's Enemies, Forreign, Domeſtick, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of Trade, abundance of Riches, the ſtatelineſs of it's Palaces, and ſuch like; and it will eaſily be yielded, that every one of theſe doth make it's Contribution; but know that Righteouſneſs alone doth more toward it, than all them put together. This, this was it that made the faithful City, Princeſs of the Provinces, and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in <hi>Iſraels</hi> Poſſeſſion (ſo long as <hi>Iſrael</hi> walked with God) a Land of deſire, an heritage of Glory, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Plato,</hi> a great and excellent <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſay, <hi>Nemo rectè honorat animam ſuam, niſi qui vitiis fugatis juſtitiam colit.</hi> None truly Honours his own Soul, but he that bidding defiance to vice, Loves and embraceth Virtue. The ſame may as truly be ſaid of a Nation. Righteouſneſs, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is it's Glory and Defence. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sin is a reproach to any People.</hi> Mark that, <hi>any People.</hi> Let a People be never ſo low, abject, contemptible, Sin will make them lower yet. And let a people be never ſo great, famous and renowned, Sin will be a blot in their Eſcutcheon. It is a reproach to an Heathen People, to Turks, Pagans Indians, but much more ſo to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an People, to a people that profeſs themſelves Proteſtants and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that call themſelves the People of God. O <hi>England!</hi> what
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40119:166"/> cauſe then haſt thou to bluſh? How great is thy ſhame, O <hi>London!</hi> who haſt had ſo many of Chriſts Embaſſadors ſent unto thee with the Counſels of his Will, ſo many bright Stars of the firſt magnitude ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in thine Orb, ſuch Plenty and abundance of means and ſpiritual Mercies afforded to thee, as no Nation hath had more, if any ſo much? Thou haſt been exalted indeed, and lifted up to Heaven (like <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum</hi>) by theſe precious and ineſtimable enjoyments, and yet, I fear it may be ſaid, no place hath acted at an higher rate of contrariety and deſperate Oppoſition to the Goſpel, no place hath expreſt a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Enmity to Reformation and the Power of Godlineſs, no place hath ſo ſuperabounded with prophaneneſs; in no place hath prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs been more impudent and daring than in thee. Thy lewdneſs is in thy Skirts. Oh how great is thy reproach! Now it is unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Duty of all among us to endeavour the Honour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to <hi>roll away</hi> this it's reproach. And if there be any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, higher or lower, that will not heartily ſet both their hands to that work, let them know and think of it again and again, that; that very thing will be to their reproach. Yea, fall out as much to their reproach, as it was to the Honour of the <hi>Angel of the Church of Epheſus,</hi> to have ſuch a Teſtimony given of him by the faithful and true Witneſs who holdeth the ſeven Stars in his Right hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. <hi>That he could not bear them that were evil,</hi> i. e. Not with any Patience, but reproved them, and did what belonged to his Office, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them from their extravagancies, and bringing them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment of Life, or otherwiſe if incurable cutting them off from the Body, and caſting them out of Communion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let men neglect or be remiſs about the ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſs, and they will ſoon ſee the increaſe of it, for ill weeds will grow apace, ſhoot and ſpread incredibly. Men do not need to beſtow time and pains, and care to houſe them in Winter, and water them in Summer, for by a bare connivence and permiſſion they will flouriſh and abound. It is indeed a piece of great difficulty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires skill and labour to make that take and thrive which is good and excellent; ſuch is the nature of the ſoil ſince the fall; the Sin of man brought upon the very ground the curſe of God, ſo that Thorns and Thiſtles it will ſend up by whole-ſale, but if a man will eat bread; he muſt do it in the ſweat of his brows. So here the Heart of Man is ſo miſerably corrupt and depraved, that there is ſcarce any thing good that will proſper in it. That goodneſs which ſometimes ſeems to be in ſome, as to inſtance in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> is like the Morning Cloud, and early Dew that paſſeth away. That which is laſting and abiding in Perſons regenerate is for it's continuance beholden to the mighty Power and ſpecial influences of the Divine Spirit.</p>
            <p>We ſee it often and often, the experience of too many years, of ſome Generations doth ſadly prove how difficult a thing it is to bring about a Reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, one would think, ſhould commend it
<pb facs="tcp:40119:167"/> ſelf to the Conſciences of men that underſtand any thing of the mind and Will of God, nay to do any thing toward it, or to reconcile moſt Perſons to the Naming thereof, to perſwade them to break off from unwarrantable Cuſtoms, to put off old Rags which are rotten and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing, and to throw away thoſe things which have neither Marrow in them nor Fleſh upon them, but are meer Bones of Contention, and to prevail with them to make a further remove from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance toward <hi>Sion;</hi> I mean a Goſpel-worſhip and Goſpel-order. How difficult a thing is it to bring the debauched Perſon to a ſober Life, or the ſapleſs empty Formaliſt to the power of Godlineſs, and a real, hearty, thorough cloſure with the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Laws?</p>
            <p>But as for Sin and Wickedneſs, it needs not any endeavours to promote it in the World, and commend it to the practice of men, it needs no incouragement, not becauſe it is ſo good, but becauſe men are ſo bad. The Devil himſelf may ſit ſtill and let his Servants alone, they will be ſure to follow his work hard without having his Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. He might forbear and give over his Temptations, for they can and will go, yea run alone in thoſe down-hill ways of Folly: Their connate Principles of Enmity to God and Rebellion againſt him, will of themſelves break out into hoſtile Actions, as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Hay ſtackt or laid up when Green or Moiſt will fire of it's ſelf, and proceed to rage more and more. Sin is like to a fire in a Town or City, which, if it be not extinguiſhed, or at leaſt kept down and ſtopt in it's furious Career, will march from Houſe to Houſe, and ſtep from one ſide of the Street to the other, and never deſiſt ſo long as there is any combuſtible matter for it to faſten upon, and ſo till it ſet all on a flame, and bury the whole in it's own Ruine and Aſhes. Let but a prophane wretch alone, and I dare confidently ſay, you ſhall not find him long alone. He will, like a decoy, ſoon gather Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to him, and multiply them too, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.18. <hi>One Sinner deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much good.</hi> And ſo, being of his Father the Devil, and doing the works of his Father, let him enjoy his Name, call him, <hi>Abaddon, Apollyon,</hi> a Deſtroyer. He will call himſelf, an hundred to one elſe, a good Subject, a good Churchman, but he is a Deſtroyer, that is his right Name. If you would know how he doth deſtroy much good, I anſwer in theſe two things; 1. He doth it <hi>impiae vitae meritis,</hi> By the demerits and high provocations of his impious, ungodly Life. He draweth Iniquity with the Cords of Vanity, and ſo Judgment as with Cart ropes. He is as a <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Ship, which raiſeth the Storms that threaten us, and as an <hi>Achan</hi> in the Camp that arms and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Enemies that come out againſt us. To whom do we owe the Plague that hath conſumed our Inhabitants, and the Fires that have devoured our Houſes, Towns and Cities but to him and his Fraternity? <hi>Ahab</hi> ſpake very unhandſomely to one of the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when he ſaid, <hi>Art thou he that troubleth</hi> Iſrael? But <hi>Elijah</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him truly and bravely, <hi>I have not troubled Iſrael, but thou and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40119:167"/> thy Fathers houſe, in that ye have forſaken the Commandments of the Lord, and thou haſt followed</hi> Baalim, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.17, 18. It is the Idolaters, Superſtitious, and Prophane that troubled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that trouble <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and will trouble the whole world, for they provoke God to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, and to diſtribute ſorrows in his anger. 2. They deſtroy much good <hi>impiis conſiliis &amp; exemplis.</hi> By their wicked Counſels and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, while they allure, intice and perſwade, and by their practices draw others into the ſame courſes, the ſame exceſs of riot. Theſe are like <hi>Samſons</hi> Foxes with fire-brands faſtned to their tails, that ſpoil the harveſt we hoped for as the joyful reward of our Labours. How comes our youth to be tainted as they are? Who fills the eyes of Parents with tears, and their hearts with ſorrow, who travailed in birth for them that Chriſt might be formed in them, but now mourn and weep bitterly over them as loſt, becauſe vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious and extravagant? Whence is it that our hopes as to the ſucceeding generation are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly infeebled, but by means of many among us ſo notorious for prophaneneſs who make it both their work and ſport to render others as bad as themſelves? And if timely care be not taken to prevent it, we can rationally expect nothing elſe but the leaving this pleaſant Land, the Land of our Nativity to be poſſeſt by Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> who will make it mourn and groan, and ſick to the ſpewing of them out. I deſire you to lay this to your hearts, if you have any bowels of mercy and compaſſion. A little ſpark is to be narrowly watch'd, where there is ſo much tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ready to catch.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Let this be ſeriouſly conſidered, if Magiſtrates Superiour and Inferiour do not put forth their power and endeavours for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of prophaneneſs, they will pull down upon their own heads the guilt of all that prophaneneſs which is committed. And this I dare ſay, there is no man that liveth in the World, no not the beſt and moſt holy, but he hath ſins enough of his own, too too many, more than he is able to bear or to anſwer for. His own follies and miſcarriages, if bound upon him will be found ſufficient to break his back, and ſink him into the bottomleſs pit of miſery. So <hi>David</hi> tells us; and he ſpake no more than what his own ſenſe and feeling did ſuggeſt and dictate to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head, as a burthen; they, (i. e.)</hi> His own iniquities, his own head, heart and life ſins, <hi>are too heavy for me.</hi> And as it was with him ſo it is with every one; and therefore no man hath need to add to the load by heaping upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the guilt of other mens ſins too. Though it muſt be confeſt, that notwithſtanding all which the wiſeſt and moſt circumſpect perſon can do, notwithſtanding all the care he can take, he will hardly be found altogether innocent as to this. Holy <hi>Auſtin,</hi> one of the beſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſaw ſufficient, yea abundant reaſon for the putting up this humble Petition, <hi>Lord, deliver me from my other mens ſins,</hi> and it may be feared that no ſmall number of great men who have been yea and are in place of power and authority, will, when the all-ſeeing God comes to ſearch
<pb facs="tcp:40119:168"/> them, be found deeply culpable and dreadfully chargeable upon this account, and ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore others that do at this day poſſeſs the ſame or like places, are very nearly concerned to look to themſelves. <hi>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.</hi> Happy the man whom other mens ſins and dangers, falls and hurts make to beware.</p>
            <p>That hath gone for currant as a certain truth, <hi>qui non prohibet cum poteſt jubet.</hi> He that doth not forbid and prevent the commiſſion of ſin when it is in the power of his hand to do it, doth <hi>interpretativè,</hi> Command the doing of it. He allows it who winks at it, he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it who ſtops it not. He doth ſo in the account of God who is a righteous Judge. He had as good command it as ſtand by and ſee it done, and ſay nothing. And if men will in this or any other way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract guilt, they may expect to taſt the bitter Effects of it. If Rulers will ſpare offenders, let not them think that God will ſpare them. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> in a fooliſh kindneſs and pity let <hi>Benhadad</hi> go, whom God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to utter deſtruction. Now obſerve what a thundering Meſſage the <hi>Prophet</hi> brought him thereupon, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.42. <hi>Thy life ſhall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</hi> So that this kindneſs of <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Benhadad</hi> was deſperate cruelty to himſelf and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And the caſe of <hi>Eli</hi> is very pertinent to this purpoſe, and moſt worthy of obſervation. He was not only <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but <hi>Judge</hi> armed with both Parental and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical power; His Sons did not write after that Copy which he had ſet them, but were Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> wicked and prophane to a Prodigy, for they Sacrilegiouſly robbed <hi>God,</hi> and filthily abuſed the women that were aſſembled at the door of the Tabernacle, and by theſe means made the offering of the Lord to ſtink, turn'd it to an abomination. For this <hi>Eli</hi> their Father reproved them, but it was with very <hi>ſoft</hi> and ſilken words, <hi>Why do ye ſuch things? For I hear of your evil doings by all this people; nay my Sons, for it is no good report that I hear, ye make the Lords people to tranſgreſs.</hi> And here was all he did, but, Oh, how angry was God hereupon! It made his fury come up into his face. Though <hi>Eli</hi> was a good man, a Prieſt, one that God had cauſed to draw near to him, though he had reproved his Sons, and given them good advice, yet this was not enough, it would not ſerve his turn, God was greatly provoked becauſe he did proceed no further; and ſee how dreadfully he threatned him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.31. <hi>&amp;c. I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy Fathers houſe, that there ſhall not be an old man in it, thou ſhalt ſee an enemy in my habitation, the man of thine that I ſhall not cut off from my altar ſhall be to conſume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart.</hi> And the dream is doubled, the reſolution of God is fixed; this one threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that carrieth ſorrow and anguiſh enough in the bowels of it is followed with another, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 3.11. <hi>I will do a thing in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>at which both the ears of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle. I will perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Eli <hi>all that I have ſworn concerning his houſe, when I begin I will alſo make an end.</hi> God would go thorow with the work, and not only be diligent in the beginning of it, but likewiſe conſtant in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40119:168"/> and compleat in the finiſhing of it. <hi>For I have told him that I will judge his houſe for ever.</hi> Such a puniſhment ſhall be inflicted, ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den laid upon him as ſhall never be taken off, <hi>for the iniquity which he knoweth, becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi> Set a mark upon theſe laſt words, in which indeed the accent and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis lies, there was the provocation, that was it that expoſed him to the divine diſpleaſure, and brought him under ſo ſevere a judgment. His Sons made themſelves vile, they defiled, debaſed and diſhonoured themſelves, by their ſins and abominable practices they had render'd themſelves odious and loathſom in the eyes of God, and in the eyes of the people. <hi>Eli</hi> was not ignorant of this, but was told of it, it raiſed a great cry, many complaints thereof were brought to him, but he <hi>RESTRAINED THEM NOT.</hi> He did not curb them. He was too mild, and tender, and gentle, he carried the matter as one that was not zealous for his God, but afraid to offend them, and unwilling to grieve them. He did not affright and ferret them out of their prophaneneſs, they ſtill continued what they were, and held on their former courſe, and yet he did not draw the Sword of juſtice, he did not inflict upon them grievous puniſhments, though they perſever'd in the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grievous ſins, he forgot to act up to the Authority of a Father, an High-Prieſt, a Judge, and therefore God will ſeverely puniſh him. <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons run deep in Score, and becauſe, he thus let them alone, God would make <hi>Eli</hi> himſelf to pay the reckoning. Conſider of this and tremble, you indulgent, fond Parents, that hear and ſee your Childrens Lying, Swearing, Looſeneſs and Debaucheries, but let them alone, &amp; you timorous Slothful Magiſtrates, that will not make prophane perſons ſmart, know and be aſſured that your ſelves ſhall. You let them go, but Vengeance will hold you. But I proceed, for though Rulers own concerns ſhould awaken and rouze them up, yet that is not all; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If Rulers will not take due, that is, utmoſt care to ſuppreſs prophaneneſs in a Nation where their power lyeth, they take a direct courſe to pull down the wrath of God upon that whole Nation as well as upon themſelves. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath theſe paſſages, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.12. <hi>If thou be wiſe thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf, but if thou ſcorneſt thou alone ſhalt bear it.</hi> But we cannot ſay, if a Magiſtrate will not diſcharge his duty, but ſuffer wickedneſs to paſs without controul, he alone ſhall bear it; no, no, the burden may light, and lye heavy upon more ſhouldiers than his own. His remiſsneſs and neglect may turn to the ſmart of the Land, and people over whom he is ſet; the not ſhutting the floud-gates of ſin which let in a deluge of wickedneſs below, is no other than the opening of the Windows of Heaven above for the letting down Showers and Storms of wrath that ſhall drown and ſwallow up all. For want of this, as you heard under the laſt particular, God did not only with great ſeverity judge the houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> but alſo threatned <hi>to do a thing in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>or unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>as ſome read it, at which both the ears of every
<pb facs="tcp:40119:169"/> one that heard it ſhould tingle,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.11. If any enquire what that terrible thing was, I anſwer, it was no leſs than the delivering of the Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the hands of the accurſed <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> ſo that three thouſand of them fell in battel before thoſe their Enemies, and which was yet worſe, the Ark of God was taken, before which they worſhipt, and which was the ſpecial and delightful Symbol of the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them. When the Sword of Magiſtracy lieth ſtill and dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in the midſt of crying abominations, then God thinks it fit and high time to awake himſelf to the Judgment which he commanded and man neglected, and to draw his own, and how doth he then lay about him, what blows doth he give, what ſtupendous work doth he make! When one <hi>Jonah</hi> (that had been diſobedient to his God, and being ſent by him upon a Meſſage to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> took him to his heels and run another way, when he I ſay) was in the Ship, and lay in peace, and at eaſe, the whole was in danger, nor did the ſtorm ceaſe, though the Heathen Mariners called every one to his God, till the guilty Criminal received his deſerved puniſhment in being caſt into the Sea. That is a notable ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 29.4. <hi>The King by Judgment ſtabliſheth the Land.</hi> When it ſhakes and totters he ſhores it up, he ſettles and confirms it again, and makes all ſure. <hi>But he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth gifts overthrows it.</hi> Theſe do blind the eyes of men in place, and bind or tie their hands, ſo that they ſhall not do the things they ſhould. And he that receives them, that will take bribes to ſtop the courſe of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> doth overthrow the Land, he turns it upſide down, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth the very foundations of it, and when he hath once done that, where is the wiſe man that can tell me, what he will do himſelf; I can expect no other but his own being buried in its ruins, yea probably, he ſhall go firſt, and not live long enough to be a mourner at its Funeral. Whereas on the other ſide,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Magiſtrates by a vigorous ſuppreſſion of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may moſt happily both prevent the coming of thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are impending over a Nation, and remove thoſe which are incumbent and heavy upon it. They may ſtay the hand of revenging juſtice, when it is lifted up, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was, and ready to give the fatal ſtroke, and alſo they may take off the hand of God when it lies heavy upon a people, and preſſeth them ſore, or, to uſe <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>they may remove the ſtroke away from it,</hi> and hold his hand when it is about repeating of the blow. I ſhall ſpeak to both theſe under this head. They may prevent a Judgment, and diſpel that Cloud which threatens a ſtorm. Hence it was that when the people had moſt grievouſly offended and provoked God by making a Golden Calf, and then worſhipping it after the manner of <hi>Egypt, Moſes</hi> ſaid unto the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> who had gathered themſelves together unto him as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſolved to be on the Lords ſide, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.27. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>put every man his Sword by his ſide, and go in and out from Gate to Gate throughout the Camp, and ſlay every man his Brother,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40119:169"/> and every man his Companion, and every man his Neighbour. And the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Levi <hi>did according to the word of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and there fell of the People that day about three thouſand men.</hi> Obſerve his temper; He was the meekeſt Man in the Earth, of a moſt ſweet and loving Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, knowing how to bear and forbear, but now he was all on a flame, the Lamb was turned into a Lion, He was nearly and greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Name and Honour of his God, and He accordingly ſet upon the doing of Juſtice, and therefore made many a Sacrifice; and when that was done he ſaid unto the People upon the Morrow, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Ye have ſinned a great Sin, and now I will go up unto the Lord, peradventure I ſhall make an Atonement for your Sin.</hi> Now that I have done the Duty of my place, now that I have vindicated the Honour of God, now that there hath been this due Execution of Juſtice, <hi>Now</hi> I will go up unto the Lord, and I will go up in hope, now I have a <hi>peradventure</hi> to encourage me to think, that I ſhall make an Atonement for you. And let us not paſs over in ſilence, that which you have in <hi>ver.</hi> 29. of the ſame <hi>Chapter. Moſes had ſaid, Conſecrate your ſelves to day to the Lord, even every Man upon his Son, and upon his Brother, that he may beſtow upon you a Bleſſing this day.</hi> The ſhedding of Blood, of the Blood of Man, the Blood of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by the hand of Juſtice, in a cauſe deſerving Death, did not defile them, but conſecrate them. Acts of Juſtice are as acceptable to God as Sacrifice, the Blood of Sinners as the fat of Rams, and abundantly more; and ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon your doing this, the Lord may beſtow a Bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon you. <hi>Levi</hi> therefore by uſing a Sword of Injuſtice and Cruelty againſt the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> loſt the Bleſſing. When their Father <hi>Jacob</hi> called all his Sons together, ſpeaking of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, Gen.</hi> 49.5. He ſpeaks of their inſtruments of Cruelty, calls to mind their Sin, curſed their Anger and Wrath, divided them in <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſcattered them in <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> but not a word of Bleſſing. That they had loſt. Now, ſaith <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> do you quit your ſelves in this great piece of Juſtice, and you may get a Bleſſing, and ſo they did, for God choſe the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> for himſelf above all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and appointed and imployed them about his Sanctuary and Service, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.6, &amp;c. <hi>Bring the Tribe of</hi> Levi <hi>near, and preſent them before</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt, that they may Miniſter unto him.</hi> And ver. 41. <hi>Thou ſhalt take the</hi> Levites <hi>for me, I am the Lord, inſtead of all the firſt-born among the Children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And as this is the way to prevent Judgments when upon their way, ſo to remove them when they are already come. For the proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you have a famous inſtance, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. The Caſe was this: The People did double their Tranſgreſſion, in committing Idolatry and Whoredom at once. It is indeed no cauſe of wonder to ſee Spiritual and Corporal Uncleanneſs going together in Company. This kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the Wrath of God againſt them, which roſe to that height that it brake out into a Plague. The Plague did not ſtop the Sin; wicked
<pb facs="tcp:40119:170"/> men will harden themſelves againſt God, and run upon the mouth of the Cannon, on the boſſes of his Buckler. Notwithſtanding the Judgment <hi>Zimri,</hi> one of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Prince too that ſhould have ſet a better Example, impudently and daringly brought a <hi>Midianitiſh</hi> Woman in the ſight of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they were weeping before the door of the Tabernacle. While the Congregation was drown'd in Tears theſe two Wretches burned in Luſt. <hi>Phinehas</hi> was an eye-witneſs of it, and his Heart was hot within him, upon the ſight thereof he took a Javelin in his hand, entred their Tent, and ran both of them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. With this remarkable Act of Juſtice and holy revenge God was exceedingly pleaſed. As appeared by the happy conſequences, which were two, healing Mercy upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a Bleſſing upon himſelf and his Poſterity. You may read what God himſelf ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Phinehas <hi>the Son of</hi> Eleazer, <hi>the Son of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt hath turned away my wrath from the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>while he was zealous for my ſake among them, that I conſumed not the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in my Jealouſie. Wherefore ſay, Behold I give unto him my Covenant of Peace, and he ſhall have it, and his Seed after him, even the Covenant of an Everlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the Children of</hi> Iſrael. Do you ſtem the Tide of prophaneneſs, and in ſo doing you will ſtop the Bottles of Divine Wrath. And then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The Suppreſſion of prophaneneſs is an excellent way for the making Rulers an eminent and choice Bleſſing unto the People; over whom the Providence of God hath ſet them. By this means they will indeed prove, as our holy Apoſtle ſpeaks in the verſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following our Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Miniſters of God to them for good.</hi> For it is a great deal of good that is miniſtred and conveyed by them, golden Oil that is communicated by and through theſe golden Pipes; the whole Land is the better for them, every Mothers Child hath reaſon to riſe up and call them bleſſed. Briefly thus.</p>
            <p>By this means they confirm and eſtabliſh it. They are ſtrong ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, while others are wicked and curſed underminers, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 75.2, 3. <hi>When I ſhall receive the Congregation,</hi> i. e. The Government of it, when I ſhall be once ſeated upon the Throne, <hi>I will judge upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or Righteouſneſs, a vein of Righteouſneſs ſhall run through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of my Actions, they ſhall be done according to the Rule of Equity. <hi>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it are diſſolved.</hi> The Reins are now let looſe, there is a viſible, apparent diſorder both in Church and State, all things are for the preſent in Confuſion, and therefore running apace to Ruine and Diſſolution. <hi>I bear up the Pillars thereof.</hi> Some do look upon Religion and Righteouſneſs as the <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz,</hi> thoſe great and mighty Pillars which uphold a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40119:170"/> and Magiſtrates are the Perſons appointed to bear up thoſe Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; if thoſe be the <hi>Pillars,</hi> theſe are the <hi>Baſis</hi> upon which they ſtand, and theſe bear up them by judging uprightly. In this way it is they bear up the Fabrick, and keep it from crumbling into pieces, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to nothing.</p>
            <p>And further, as by this means they bring unto a Nation, the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Stability,</hi> ſo they alſo yield that other lovely and very deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bleſſing of <hi>Peace.</hi> So that all good men ſhall ſit under their own Vines and Fig-trees, without others making them afraid, they ſhall have a quiet and comfortable enjoyment of themſelves, and the good things which God hath graciouſly vouchſafed to them. Unto this, I ſay, Magiſtrates both ſupreme and ſubordinate, the higher and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers in a Kingdom do very much contribute by the Diligent and Faithful diſcharge of the Work and Duty of their ſeveral places. This is evident from that, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72.3. <hi>The Mountains ſhall bring Peace to the People, and the little hills by Righteouſneſs.</hi> That Word <hi>Peace</hi> is very comprehenſive, carrying in it not only a freedom from War, Commotions, Quarrels and Diſturbances, but Proſperity too and Happineſs, Plenty and Abundance of all good things, ſo that there ſhall be no complaining in our Streets. This is to be brought to a People, and ſure when it is they will bid it welcome; but who ſhall bring it? The Mountains and little Hills. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ones, the Magiſtrates, the King and all that are in Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, but it will come only in a way of Righteouſneſs: Gods Peace always keeps Gods Way. This you learn from that of the Prophet, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 85.10. <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace kiſs each other.</hi> They meet and embrace, and ſo go hand in hand; Righteouſneſs in the Throne, in the Senate, and Courts of Judicature is accompanied with Peace in the City, yea and all the Countrey over.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, A Conſcientious care for the Suppreſſion of prophaneneſs in a Land, is the way to engage the great and Holy God on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and for the good of thoſe Rulers in whom that care is found. And this Argument will, I am ſure, ſignifie much with all thoſe, with whom God ſignifieth any thing. As the place of Rulers is high, ſo the work of their place is hard: It carrieth a great deal of difficulty and of danger along with it: As wicked men are very fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, they are <hi>always grievous.</hi> They are like the raging Sea which is continually caſting up Mire and Dirt, ſpecially when there is a Storm upon it. Let there be endeavours uſed to put a ſtop to them in their ſinful courſe, by a vigorous Execution of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws, their Hearts do preſently ſwell againſt thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain and puniſh them, and they break out into a rage, whereupon they often ſtudy to avenge the quarrel of their ſordid and impetuous Luſts upon thoſe Worthies, who would promote the cleanneſs of their Lives. and the welfare of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Upon this account it is no more than neceſſary for the Omnipotent
<pb facs="tcp:40119:171"/> God to ſtand at their right hand, for the encouragement of their Hearts and the preſervation of their Perſons. Now ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> 7.10. <hi>My defence is of God, who ſaveth the upright in Heart.</hi> When men are upright in their Hearts and alſo in their Way they may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Righteous is as bold as a Lion.</hi> And well he may, for though he may be faced and environ'd by many dangers from men, yet his defence is of God. And that may well be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd enough to ſecure him from ſinkings and diſcompoſures of mind. What is the matter, though poiſoned Arrows and fiery Darts flie thick? So long as God is a mans ſhield, He will quench them all.</p>
            <p>And as God will defend them, ſo he will put a Glory upon them, and maintain their Glory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.30. <hi>Them that Honour me I will Honour.</hi> He is reſolved upon it. Thoſe Perſons that Honour him by the Holineſs of their walking. Thoſe Profeſſors that Honour him by owning him and his Truths and ways in times of furious Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Perſecution, and thoſe Rulers that Honour him by a faithful Execution of Juſtice, puniſhing thoſe that diſhonour him, them God will Honour, and He will make them great and honourable in the eyes of others. Their Government ſhall be highly commended, their Perſons ſhall be greatly eſteemed, and their Memory ſhall be bleſſed, whereas in the ſame place He tell us, they that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed, not only by himſelf but by all.</p>
            <p>Yea and God will ſee to it, that things ſhall go well with them, as he ſaid, when ſpeaking to <hi>Jehojachin</hi> that wicked Son of famous <hi>Joſiah, Jer.</hi> 22.15. <hi>Did not thy Father eat and drink, and do Judgment and Juſtice, and then it was well with him?</hi> He began to Reign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when he was very young. But he began and went on well, He was a Religious, Gracious and Righteous Prince, in his days Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was in it's Beauty, and the Righteous did flouriſh, and it was well with him, good for him, he taſted the ſweetneſs of it, and reap'd the advantage. He did eat and drink, not to gluttony and drunkenneſs, as is the faſhion of too many, but he did Reign in Peace and Plenty. God furniſhed his Table and filled his Cup. The Lord bleſt him, ſo that there was nothing wanting to the Comfort of his Life, or the ſupporting of his Royal State. He was not negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his duty, nor God ſparing of his Mercy and Kindneſs to him. Thus I have given many Reaſons why Magiſtrates ſhould be careful to ſuppreſs prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the laſt thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew what means ought to be uſed in order hereunto. In general I would ſay this, thoſe that go about it, will certainly find that a little matter will not do. Wickedneſs is ſo natural to fallen man, and his Heart is ſo ſet in him to do evil, and oftentimes Sin is grown to ſuch a prodigious height in a Land, and ſo exceedingly overſpread the face of it, and thoſe who take pleaſure in committing it are arrived at that pitch of reſolution and daring boldneſs, that it is no eaſie thing to give an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40119:171"/> check. As the doing of it will be greatly acceptable to God, and iſſue in the everlaſting Honour of Rulers, ſo to ſet upon it and go thorow with it, doth neceſſarily require heighth of courage, fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Reſolution, ſtrength of Zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> utmoſt induſtry and conſtant care. And when they ſet Heart and Hand to it, they will find both Heart and Hands full. But for the anſwering of this Queſtion, I ſhall humbly propound and offer to the ſerious Conſideration and due Practice of all thoſe that are in Authority, from our Dread and Dear Sovereigns the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> who ſit upon the Throne, to the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſtables and Head-burroughs who walk up and down the Streets, theſe following particulars, which I deſire may be minded and done by all according to their ſeveral places, and thoſe various parts of Power and Government with which they are intruſted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It will be highly conducing hereunto, if they all would in their own Perſons and Converſations make it their buſineſs to ſet good Examples. For that old ſaying doth carry a great deal of Truth in it,
<q>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</q> The manners of the People are much ſquared by and conformed to thoſe of the Prince. The experiences of moſt, if not all Ages and Countreys, do afford abundant proofs of this. Though you need go no further than the ſacred Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> We ſee it to be thus in ſmaller Societies, Children will not queſtion the doing of that which they have known done by their Parents before them, and uſually Servants will conclude that lawful which they have ſeen practiſed by their Maſters; and ſo the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Subjects will not ſtick at what they obſerve in the Life and Carriage of their Sovereign, ſo that it be not too high for them, and out of their reach, as perhaps ſome have found in theſe Cities to their coſt and ruine. All examples have certainly in them a very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Power <hi>(exempla cogunt)</hi> ſpecially thoſe that are bad. The worſt have the ſtrongeſt influence, becauſe they meet in others that ſee or hear of them with a wretched principle of Corruption that likes and approves of them, a vile Nature which delights <hi>(ſequi deteriorem partem)</hi> to follow the worſt part But of all bad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thoſe that are ſet by great Perſons are the moſt prevalent; and therefore it becomes them to walk circumſpectly, and be very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was without controverſie the greateſt Perſon that ever the World had, for he thought it no Robbery to be equal with <hi>God,</hi> which thought was no errour or miſtake, and St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. calls him <hi>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth.</hi> Now his whole Life was no other than the ſetting of a moſt exact and excellent Copy, for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men to write after, more particularly all thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Name, and profeſs themſelves to be in the number of his Diſciples. And ſurely the great men of the Earth, chiefly thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:40119:172"/> are and would be counted Chriſtians, are obliged as in other his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Actions, ſo in this to reſemble him; that they may be able without any ſtinging Reflection to ſay to others in a lower Sphere, <hi>Do as you ſee me do,</hi> and live as you ſee I live. Why will you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Name of God by your Oaths and Curſes, or the Day of God by your Paſtimes and Sports, or abuſe the Mercies and good Creatures of God to Gluttony and Drunkenneſs? do you ſee any ſuch thing in me? It was a brave and noble Reſolution that holy <hi>David</hi> took up betimes when he was ready to aſcend the Royal Throne, or newly ſeated in it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101.2. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way, I will walk within mine Houſe with a perfect Heart.</hi> Obſerve how extenſive his care was, reaching both to his Heart and Way. To his Heart, as one that had to do with <hi>God,</hi> who ſearched it: And to his Way, as one that had to do with Men who obſerved it. He would do this, that, if it were poſſible, He might allure and draw others to walk in the ſame way of Wiſdom and Holineſs as Himſelf had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; but however he would do this, that none of them might have his pattern to juſtifie and embolden any of them in their ways of wickedneſs. Of all Perſons, Parents in a Family, Miniſters in the Church, and Magiſtrates in a Kingdom ought to be very careful and curious, they ſhould <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, take heed to their way, and foot it right. For thoſe that do not, prove publick peſts and miſchiefs, going up and down to the infecting of many.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As ſuch ſhould make it their buſineſs to Live prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs down, ſo it will be an excellent thing for them to Frown it down. Let them not beſtow their ſmiles upon thoſe that Practiſe it, for thoſe ſmiles are miſplaced. <hi>Princes</hi> will do well not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them into their Courts, nor to make them the objects of their ſpecial Favour. We find the Lord ſpeaking thus, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.1. <hi>When I would have healed</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Iniquity of</hi> Ephraim <hi>was diſcovered, and the Sin of</hi> Samaria. I find ſome Expoſitors do by <hi>Ephraim</hi> there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Court, for certain after the revolt of the ten Tribes from the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> in the days of <hi>Rehoboam, Samaria</hi> was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis or Capital City of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This being ſo, we may by warrant of that Text lay down this poſition: If there be Iniquity in <hi>Ephraim,</hi> no man hath any reaſon to wonder that he finds Wickedneſs in <hi>Samaria.</hi> Sins in the Court will diffuſe themſelves, and not be kept out of the City, no nor the Countrey neither. Therefore holy <hi>David</hi> did not only reſolve to take ſpecial care of himſelf, though it was his Wiſdom to begin there, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the right end, but he did not ſhut up his care within ſo narrow bounds: He did not limit it to himſelf, but would look about him, and have an Eye upon his Domeſticks, all thoſe that ſhould live with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.3. <hi>A froward Heart ſhall depart from me, I will not know a wicked Perſon.</hi> Aſſoon as I have diſcovered ſuch an one, and found him to be of an evil Temper and Life, He ſhall
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40119:172"/> away, he muſt depart from me if he be a worker of iniquity. I will caſt him and turn him out of doors, my Palace ſhall be no place for ſuch vermin. I will not know him. He ſhall be none of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or retinue. And indeed there is very good reaſon, why they ſhould be out of credit at Court who are a diſcredit to the God they own, and the Religion they profeſs. Marks of ſpecial favour are at all times and in all places very unhappily beſtowed upon ſuch as do by their Leudneſs and Debauchery deſerve the blackeſt brands of infamy. And whatever other abilities and accompliſhments they may have, I think it is very hard and hazardous to truſt them who do not fear God. None are before the throne of <hi>God</hi> in Heaven but holy Angels, and the Saints <hi>who have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, Rev.</hi> 7.14. Evil ſhall not dwell with him, nor ſhall the workers of iniquity ſtand in his ſight. And then will things be well indeed, when none but ſuch are ſuffered to ſtand before the Thrones of earthly <hi>Princes</hi> his Subſtitutes and Vicegerents. The way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs would not be ſo beaten a road as it hath been, but have far fewer Travellers, when all ſhall ſee that it doth not lead to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To be ſevere againſt the wicked is a convincing argument of a Princes wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.26. <hi>A wiſe King ſcattereth the wicked, and bringeth the Wheel over them.</hi> And in this way he doth provide for his own ſecurity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Take away</hi> the wicked from before the King, and his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs. When Cardinal <hi>Julian</hi> was commended to <hi>Sigismund,</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>Tamen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus eſt.</hi> Let ſuch or ſuch a man be commended for never ſo much, if it may be ſaid, <hi>Tamen profanus eſt,</hi> that ſhould be enough for a bar in his way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another excellent way for the ſuppreſſing of prophaneneſs is an oppoſition made to it by ſevere Laws; yea to every ſin that falls within the cognizance of the Civil Magiſtrate, &amp; runs upon the point of his Sword. And by thoſe Laws let puniſhment be provided for it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its nature and demerit. For all ſins are not equal in themſelves, and therefore there ought to be a diverſity in the puniſhment. Let Rulers thunder moſt terribly againſt thoſe abominations that have the loudeſt cry in the Ears of Heaven; make the ſtrongeſt fence againſt that ſin, which above all others threatens the Land with an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and be ſure to ſpend the moſt angry and formidable frowns upon the boldeſt and moſt daring outrages. Let Laws, Kingdoms and Common-wealths be ſure to look thoſe ſins out of Countenance, which are of all other moſt impudent, and look men in the face with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bluſh, and walk up and down in our Streets at noon-day. This to do is one part of the work belonging to our King and Parliament, with whom alone is lodged the Legiſlative power, whoſe meetings are to be for the publick good, with which they are intruſted, and for the promoting whereof they were choſen and ſent. And as they will anſwer for it to the Holy; Righteous, and Eternal God, who is
<pb facs="tcp:40119:173"/> a Conſuming Fire, they are ſtrictly obliged, and that at their peril, to take care that thoſe Laws which they make be not grievous, but righteous, have not a malignant, but benign influence, and that by them every mans Property may be ſecured, that Religion which is warranted by Scripture, and ſo pure and undefiled before God and the Father be not Diſcouraged, Puniſhed, and firſt driven into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and then ferreted out of them, but countenanced and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; and that all that, whatſoever it be, that is contrary to Godlineſs and ſound Doctrine, as well as that which diſturbs the publick peace, and creates uncivil diſorders may be kept down, and as far as is poſſible, baniſhed out of a Land. We read, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 94.20. <hi>of a throne of iniquity that frameth miſchief by a Law.</hi> If there never had been ſuch Thrones in the World, there would not have been that mention made of them in the Scripture. But ſuch there have been: That of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> was one, who would not ſuffer the people according to the divine Command to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip God, who had there placed his name, but ſpread for them that went, nets upon <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and ſet ſnares upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> and ſuch Thrones there have been ſince, too many of them. Well, Saith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ſhall they have fellowſhip with thee?</hi> No, no, God keeps his diſtance from them, thoſe that we call ſtinking dunghils are not offenſive to God as Thrones of iniquity are, which ſhall neither be approved by him nor ſecured. Stay a while, Chriſtians, and in patience poſſeſs your Souls, for the World ſhall ſee that in due time he will overturn them all. That, yea that throne ſhall have fellowſhip with God, which doth puniſh miſchief by a Law.</p>
            <p>We have had for ſome conſiderable time a great deal of diſcourſe about Penal Laws, and men have been much divided in their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and apprehenſions concerning them; for my part, I think that Nation is extreamly deficient which is altogether without them, the Hedge of it is taken away, the Wall of it is broken, and it will eaſily be troden down. But I heartily wiſh and pray that all Penal Laws may be framed according to the mind of the Supream Law-giver; Let the ax be whetted as ſharp as it ſhould be, ſo that its edge be once turn'd and always kept the right way. Spare neither odious Idolatry, nor unſociable Popery, nor damnable Hereſy, nor deſtructive prophaneneſs, but under your ſhadow let Religion, Truth and the Power of godlineſs live, and a Scriptural Reformation grow and be carried on towards its perfection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let righteous and good Laws, that are made, have their free courſe, and the Sword of Juſtice be drawn, and not ſuffered to lye ruſting in the Scabbard, as it will certainly do when put into the hand of a careleſs <hi>Gallio,</hi> or of perſons that allow themſelves in the Commiſſion of thoſe ſins which the Law condemns, or in the hand of thoſe that have not ſomething of courage and a greatneſs of Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſtice at all times is not to be expected from a wicked and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40119:173"/> debauched, Perſon or a Coward. A fearful Magiſtrate or Civil Officer in a City, Town or Countrey is as bad and as great an abſurdity as a timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and white-liver'd Souldier in the Field; for as the one will fly before a Bullet, ſo will the other fall before a frown, and ſo while his heart fails him, the hand of juſtice grows feeble. His fear will ſometimes keep him from doing of that which is right, and at other times it will put him upon the doing of that which is wrong. This was the cauſe of <hi>Pilates</hi> miſcarriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made way for the unjuſt condemnation and Crucifixion of the beſt and holieſt, the greateſt and moſt glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World, our dear Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed were madly ſet for his death, but <hi>Pilates</hi> wife ſent him this meſſage, <hi>Have thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with that juſt man.</hi> He himſelf ſaid <hi>that he found no fault in him,</hi> which he thrice repeated, and when he ſaw the Jews were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, he took water, and waſhed his hands before the multitude: (if that would have done) ſaying, <hi>I am innocent of the blood of this juſt Man.</hi> But when the people cried out, <hi>If thou let this man go, thou art not</hi> Caeſars <hi>Friend,</hi> he was afraid, and delivered him up to ſufferings. But I am guilty of digreſſing. That which we were ſpeaking of is the execution of righteous Laws. For to what purpoſe are they made? Surely not only to be read, or talked of, and lye by, or be ſet up as meer ſcare-crows in Trees to keep Birds from Cherries, but to be made uſe of as occaſion requires. There muſt be not only ſpeaking againſt ſin, but ſtriking at it, elſe it will not down. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>Rulers bear not the Sword in vain.</hi> By the Sword, he means that of Authority and Power, good Laws, together with all the means and inſtruments of puniſhment, and they are not to bear this Sword in vain. It muſt be brandiſhed, wielded and ſheathed in the bowels of ſin. What are the beſt Laws but a Company of dead things, unleſs Magiſtrates put life into them by a vigorous Execution? And it is very ſad at any time when there is cauſe given of ſaying there is a Law againſt prophaning of the Lords day, a Law againſt Swearing, a Law againſt Drunkenneſs and Whoredom, but where is the man that doth put theſe Laws in Execution? There are many wretches that break the Laws, but where are thoſe that will make them feel the Penalty? This is the honour of a City and the comfort of a People, when it may be ſaid, here is a good Law againſt ſuch a vice, and ſuch a vice, and here is a good Mayor, a good Juſtice of Peace, a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable that will execute it. Good Laws without good Magiſtrates and Officers will never make a people happy.</p>
            <p>But further, As there muſt be an execution of righteous Laws, ſo an impartiality in that execution. <hi>Judgment ſhould run down as Water, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream, Amos</hi> 5.24. In a conſtant current, without interruption bearing down all before it, all private and little conſiderations that would break it off. As to thoſe Juſtice ought to be blind, not ſeeing nor taking notice of them. And Laws ought not to be cobwebs that catch the little flies, and let the great ones make
<pb facs="tcp:40119:174"/> their way thorough. The <hi>greater</hi> the perſon is that offends, the greater and more heinous upon that very account, is the offence which he commits. His greatneſs is an aggravation, and renders his ſin of a much deeper dye. The <hi>nearer</hi> the offender is to the Magiſtrate, the greater is the Magiſtrates honour in puniſhing him. It was the honour of <hi>Levi</hi> and as ſuch it is ſet and left upon record, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9. <hi>That he ſaid unto his Father and to his Mother, I have not ſeen him, neither did he acknowledge his Brethren, nor knew his own Children, for they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thy word, and kept thy Covenant.</hi> This refers to that Execution which had been by them done upon thoſe who had worſhipped the Golden Calf. And as this is a great honour to the Magiſtrate, ſo will it ſtrike a great terrour upon by-ſtanders. Whereas that Officer who is known to pardon a Malefactor upon this or that or the other by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, will not himſelf know how to puniſh it in another. The very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that remiſsneſs and neglect would make his hand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when he draws his Warrant or makes his Mittimus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.3. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep Judgment, and he that doth righteouſneſs at all times. Non abreptus affectibus, periculis, ſpe lucri, &amp;c.</hi> Not byaſt, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by affections, fear of danger, hope of gain, or any thing of like nature. <hi>Fiat juſtitia, ruat coelum.</hi> Let who will be diſpleaſed, and what will follow, juſtice ought to be done. For want of this, prophaneneſs and all manner of abominations will greatly increaſe and abound, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily executed, therefore the heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> They grow audacious and deſperate, they are reſolved upon their way, they go on with a full ſail to the Commiſſion of ſin. And if the meer deferring of judgment will produce ſo bad an effect, what will not the total neglect of it, or partiality in it do?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, An excellent way therefore for the attainment of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent end, the ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſs, is the putting of the Sword of Juſtice into the hands of good and faithful men. I do not go about to make parties in the Nation: God forbid! it is contrary to my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, there hath been too much of it in the Nation, and in the world, and oh that there may be no more. Oh that God would in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his goodneſs heal all our breaches and compoſe all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fferences, and grant that we may all ſerve him in the beauties of holineſs with one ſhoulder and one conſent. Oh that I might ſee it done. In the mean time I am verily perſwaded, that among every one of the different parties in the Land, who hold the head, and are ſound in the vitals of Chriſtianity, the main Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points of our Religion, there are to be found perſons fearing God. And if I may have leave humbly to ſpeak my thoughts, I count it a great pity that any of them ſhould be laid aſide as Veſſels in which there is no pleaſure, as perſons altogether uſeleſs and unfit to be truſted and imployed, meerly becauſe they diſſent from others of their Brethren
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40119:174"/> in thoſe things which are acknowledged to be indifferent, but cannot be by them complyed with, leſt they ſhould ſin againſt God, and wound their own Conſciences, ſo long as they are ſound in the faith, ſet for the glory of God, and for the honour of the King, and for the publick good. Why, Oh! Why may not ſuch men be owned and incouraged, and imployed in thoſe things of which they are capable? Are they fit for nothing becauſe there is ſomething that they cannot do? I know and all men muſt yield it, that there have been and will be as well as are, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Judgments, and by conſequence of practice. No man hath his Judgment, Faith and Reaſon at his Command, and it is as poſſible to make all men of a Stature as of a mind. But I muſt and do humbly ſubmit this to our Superiours, withal leaving particular perſons to their ſeveral Sentiments, and to walk accordingly to that light which they have received, and begging of God the haſtning of that day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.9. Wherein <hi>the Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth;</hi> and wherein there ſhall be <hi>one Lord, and his name one. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na fides, &amp; una Deum colendiratio.</hi> One Faith and one Worſhip.</p>
            <p>This I take for certain, That ungodlineſs is very unlikely to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a Nation, when the ungodly and wicked men of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are the men intruſted with and imployed about the ſupreſſion thereof. It is not probable that a Swearing and Curſing Magiſtrate will puniſh another for his Oaths, or a Drunken Magiſtrate will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Legal penalty upon another for the like brutiſhneſs. Or an unclean Officer make another ſmart for his Whoredom. While he is going about it an hundred to one there will be a bitter Reflection, the man will find a ſting within himſelf, his own Conſcience, if it be not fear'd or in a profound ſleep, cannot forbear flying in his face, and asking him in his ear this pinching queſtion, How canſt thou puniſh that in this perſon which thou knoweſt to be thine own practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22, 23. <hi>Thou that ſayeſt a man ſhould not commit adultery, doſt thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacriledge? Thou that makeſt thy boaſt of the Law, through breaking the Law diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou God?</hi> Upon this account it was that holy <hi>David</hi> reſolved, <hi>his eye ſhould be upon the faithful of the Land, Pſal.</hi> 101.6. He would expreſs his ſpecial favour upon thoſe that were of known integrity, that would faithfully mind and perform the duty of their place, and be true to their God and to their truſt, and ſaith he, <hi>He that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerve me,</hi> viz. in governing the Nation, and in ſeeing to it, that good orders be kept. And I look upon that as a good ſaying of one, <hi>Melior eſt Reſpublica &amp; tutior,</hi> &amp;c. That Common-wealth or Kingdom is ſafer and in a much better condition, in which there is a bad Prince, than that which hath in it bad Magiſtrates, Officers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In order to the effectual ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſs it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be owned as abſolutely neceſſary, to watch diligently and deal ſeverely with the Nurſeries of it. For as our Lord Jeſus, who is the King
<pb facs="tcp:40119:175"/> of <hi>Sion</hi> &amp; Saints, hath his Schools &amp; Nurſeries for the inſtructing &amp; training up of perſons in ſound knowledge &amp; true holineſs. Such are the aſſemblies and congregrations of his people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his ways.</hi> So <hi>Satan,</hi> the Prince of the power of the air, the Spirit that worketh in the Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, hath his Nurſeries, which he fills with curſed Temptations, and his Inſtruments with Venomous examples, in order to the alluring of men to flagitious courſes, and rendering them expert, ready and compleat Artiſts in ſin. And do not all men ſee how our youths are tainted and corrupted there, and how many of thoſe that once were hopeful and thought to be plants of righteouſneſs have been there blaſted, and turned into the degenerate plants of a ſtrange Vine, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Grapes of <hi>Sodom</hi> and the Cluſters of <hi>Gommorrah?</hi> All that read theſe lines may eaſily underſtand my meaning, what houſes they are at which I now point. And I would ask, Are Stews and Brothel-houſes fit to be ſuffered among us? I have not at all wonder'd, when I have read and heard, how many of them are allowed in <hi>Rome,</hi> that Mother of Harlots, who holds in her hand a Cup of fornication; we muſt expect the great Whore will not fall out with the little Ones, ſpecially when they are profitable to her. <hi>Bonus odor lucri ex re quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi> In her Noſtrils the money ſmells well, come it from whence it will. But it is an arrant ſhame that any of them ſhould be found in a Land of Light, in a Nation of Proteſtants, in a City of righteouſneſs, in a place where that Religion is profeſt and eſtabliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that condemns all ſuch filthy practices. And as for Ale-houſes and Victualling houſes, though ſome of them, poſſibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are uſeful, yea and neceſſary, yet is there need of ſuch multitudes, in which ſo many ſit many hours together fuddling, and drinking away their money, their wits, their health and their Souls, while their poor Wives ſit at home mourning, and their Children crying, and perhaps all of them wanting and ready to ſtarve? I am ſure, none ought to have Licenſes for the keeping ſuch houſes who will ſuffer them to be places of licentiouſneſs, and not be careful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve good hours and orders.</p>
            <p>Seventhly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let all inferiour Officers be very careful and diligent in their places. For their places are not dormitories, places to idle and ſleep in, but to watch and work in. Church-wardens, Conſtables and others have a very conſiderable power, and without doubt they have it not for nothing. And as it is given them for good ends, ſo for thoſe ends they ought to imploy it. That power is in vain which is not reduced into Act. The Staff which you Conſtables carry up and down with you is for ſomething more than a bare and empty ſign, and to tell people what you are, and though you do frequently leave your Staff at home, yet I pray, be ſure to carry your eyes and ears along with you to the fartheſt bounds of your juriſdiction. What a great deal of good may be done, and what abundance of wickedneſs may be prevented
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40119:175"/> by one active perſon. And I think I am not miſtaken when I reckon upon a curious inquiſition as one part of the work of your Office. Surely it is not for you to ſit ſtill at home till you are alarm'd and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth by riots and uproars in the Streets, or have men come with their complaints rapping at your doors, but you ſhould take your walks, and make enquiry after evil-doers, find out their neſts, and haunts; See what Companies meet in publick houſes, for entertainment, and what they do, how they behave themſelves when they are together, and be ſure to diſſolve their wicked Clubs, and debauched meetings and carry the Perſons whom you find ſo tranſgreſſing before thoſe Superiour Magiſtrates whom you know moſt hearty and active in their places. For, verily, when there are good and excellent Laws in a Land for the regulating of things, and correcting that which is amiſs, and yet ſin grows becauſe of a Male-adminiſtration, much, very much of the guilt will be chargeable upon and lie at the doors of inferiour Officers, more than they will be able to anſwer for.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Let thoſe Officers which are faithful in their places have their due and full encouragement, and not be ſnibb'd, and brow-beaten and taken up ſhort, and treated with abuſive Language and frowns as they have been in the late times, when practices of Religion were hated and puniſhed as the worſt of Crimes, and a Company of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Informers that neither had a drachm of honeſty, nor were worth a Groat, were hugg'd and entertain'd with welcom and applauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their part in the fines which they gaped for as the wages of their unrighteouſneſs. Honeſt, vigilant and active Officers who are in the diſcharge of their duty, and proceed no farther than the Law im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers them, ought to be commended, they that do well deſerve to hear well, and not be counted or called buſy fellows ſo long as they are imployed about their own buſineſs. Yea and they ought to be aſſiſted too. Where the Conſtables Staff will not do the work, let the Juſtice of Peace draw his Sword. And when they have brought the matter as far as they can, let them that have higher power ſet their hands to it and carry it on further. It cannot but be a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to honeſt men, when they have found out and ſeized upon Ranting, Roaring Debauchees, and brought them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Curſing and Storming, their heats and huffs, before their Superior, and then he ſhall receive them with <hi>one</hi> Complement, and after the ſpeaking a few words of courſe diſmiſs them with <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Such men as theſe may be aſſaulted by a Temptation to grow cold and remiſs, but I do adviſe and deſire them not to yield to that Temptation, for ſtill this may be their comfort, that they have not been wanting unto their duty, and the other muſt and ſhall anſwer for his neglect, poſſibly to the higher powers below, or if not to them, yet for certain at laſt to that God who is higher than the higheſt, and ſits in the Throne judging right,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:176"/> and from whom every one ſhall receive according as his work hath been.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, An Orthodox and Godly Miniſtry is a very choice and excellent means for the ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſs. Surely this ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured Monſter, though grown up to a gigantick Stature and bigneſs, is moſt like to fall, when it is oppoſed and ſet upon by the Magiſtrate who bears the Sword of Civil power, and by the Miniſter too who bears and draws againſt it the Sword of the Spirit, which hath been by God committed to him, and thoſe other weapons with which he is furniſhed out of the divine armory, and which, according to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. He hath or ought to have <hi>in a readineſs for the revenging of all diſobedience.</hi> And therefore I heartily wiſh, that as a <hi>learned</hi> (and ſo much the better by how much the more learned) Miniſtry may be kept up in the Land, both in Cities and Countreys, and in order to that, ſufficient liberal proviſion made for them; So ſuch and only ſuch may be imployed in that high and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Function, as in the Judgment of rational Charity may be looked upon as being indeed the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And the two <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Marks or Characters by which ſuch may be known, are the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Doctrine, their living of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and according to his Rules, and their doing of both theſe will conduce and contribute very much to this great end. This will be ſingularly promoted by their preaching of Chriſt, not Ceremonies, but Chriſt, not impoſed forms of prayer, but the power of Godlineſs, not only Morality but true Piety, not the Croſs in Baptiſm, but crucifying the fleſh with the affections and luſts, not bowing to the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but to the Authority and Government and Law of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not a white Garment, but the linnen of Saints, righteouſneſs and holineſs. I do not at all deny but Civility and Morality are duties, very Goodly Pearls, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and becoming. Oh that there were more of them to be found among us! It is beyond all queſtion that they who would be Saints muſt not be beaſts: I cannot think any fit matter for a viſible Church, who are Devils incarnate. Nor do I deny but that many uſeful Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, good Precepts and Rules may be fetched from Heathen Authors, <hi>Plato, Seneca, Tully, Plutarch,</hi> &amp;c. But we need not borrow Jewels of <hi>Egyptians,</hi> bleſſed be God, nor go down to the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> for the ſharpening of our Mattocks. It is <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> which is the power of God to Salvation. There is no need of quoting a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> when we have a <hi>Paul.</hi> What examples can we produce and propound ſo exact and curious as is that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth? He ſpake ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as never man ſpake, and he walked ſo as never man walk'd. What arguments can we find more convincing than thoſe of the Scripture which are mighty for caſting down the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Imaginations, Conceits, Reaſonings of a carnal, vain and proud mind? What motives more perſwaſive and alluring than thoſe of the Goſpel, which are indeed the cords of a man? What
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40119:176"/> Thunder-claps can be thought of more terrible, or what Terrours more amazing and affrighting than the Terrours of the Lord? What Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more inviting and encouraging than thoſe he hath given us, which are exceeding great and precious? Where, if any one can, let him tell us where we ſhall ſee Sin ſo clearly and fully in its deformity and ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in order to a real and thorow averſation from it, or Religion, Godlineſs and a Converſation order'd aright, more in it's lovelineſs and enamouring beauty, in order to our ſetting our Hearts upon it, than we do, or at leaſt, may ſee it in the Goſpel? When all is ſaid and done that can be, it is the Grace of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Doctrine, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Grace, which bringeth Salvation, and hath appeared to all men.</hi> Jews and Gentiles, men of all ſorts and ranks, it is that, yea it is that <hi>which teacheth us,</hi> and all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſit under it, <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World.</hi> Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this precious and everlaſting Goſpel of God our Saviour may be the main object of Miniſters ſtudy, and the Principal Theme upon which they inſiſt in their ſeveral Congregations, therein imitating the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who told the <hi>Corinthians, He determined to know nothing among them but Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all. Miniſters ought not only to preach Chriſt, but likewiſe to live him. What good are thoſe pretended Miniſters like to do, in whatever Place, Countrey or Nation they are to be found, who are ſcandalous and prophane? Grant that ſome of them preach well, I would fain know whether that be enough, either to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or thoſe that hear them. What ſuch men ſeem to build up by their Doctrine, they pull down by their Practice. Let any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man judge, whether they are like to convince and perſwade others, who do lead ſelf-contradicting lives. How can they prevail with others to be ſober, who will ſit and quaffe, and be drunk themſelves? With what face can they perſwade others to poſſeſs their veſſels in Sanctification and Honour, who are unclean and filthy themſelves? In ſhort, how are they like to lead others in the way everlaſting, who do themſelves turn aſide to crooked paths with the workers of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Oh that therefore care might be taken by all thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Power, and have the overſight of ſuch things as theſe, that thoſe and none but thoſe may be ſet as ſpiritual Guides and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers over the ſeveral Flocks and Congregations in the Land, as may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing ſay to their hearers, <hi>Walk ſo as ye have us for an Example, and be ye Followers of us even as we are of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly and Laſtly, In order to the effectual Suppreſſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, I would and do heartily commend to all thoſe that are in Authority over us diligent, yea and utmoſt care for the ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the firſt day of the Week, which is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lords Day, and ought to be kept as the Chriſtian Sabbath to the end of time. A day ſanctified and ſet apart for the ſolemn publick and private worſhip of God both in Churches, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb facs="tcp:40119:177"/> and Retirements, and for a ſweet, cloſe, and intimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, while we are deliver'd and taken off from thoſe ſecular affairs, that upon the other days of the Week do neceſſarily engage us, and cannot but divert us. A day not to be ſpent in any thing, no not any, the moſt minute part of it, but the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and works of Godlineſs, except thoſe works of Neceſſity and Mercy, which God out of his Goodneſs and Pity to man doth allow; for he will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice, ſo that when Acts of Mercy are of abſolute Neceſſity, Sacrifice ſhall give place to it. This is a day which God hath ſeen fit to uſher in with a <hi>Memento</hi> in the fourth Commandment, <hi>Remember that thou keep Holy the Sabbath day.</hi> As if the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould have ſaid, I know your frailty, that you have ſlippery and treacherous memories, and poſſibly may, yea certainly will forget ſome, nay many other things, in which you are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but let this be faſtened as a nail in a ſure place, be ſure to think of this, to be mindful of this. I charge and command you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it. Remember the Sabbath day before it comes, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the thoughts of it, to long for it, and to prepare for it, that upon the day of Praiſe you may have on your Garments of Praiſe, Souls in a right frame, and remember to ſanctifie and keep it Holy when it is come.</p>
            <p>We find the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was given unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a ſign between God and them. So you have it in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.12. <hi>I gave them my Sabbaths to be a ſign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that ſanctifie them.</hi> By this they were diſtinguiſhed from all other Nations. Theſe were a plain and evident proof that they were the Lords People, and that <hi>Jehovah</hi> was their God. This did loudly proclaim <hi>Gods</hi> chooſing and calling them out from the reſt of the World, and gracious ſetting them apart for himſelf, as his peculiar Portion and Inheritance. And indeed, where there is no care of ſanctifying the Sabbath by Nations, Families or Perſons, it is a plain caſe, it amounts to a demonſtration that they are unſanctified Nations, Families and Perſons. It is an evident ſign of a people eſtranged and alienated from the Life of God, of a wicked people that ſavour not the things of God, but only thoſe things that be of men; of a People that have not the fear of God before their Eyes, that are not carried out in deſires of honouring him and lifting up his Name, or of enjoying Communion with him in the World. To prophane <hi>Sabbaths</hi> is a very great and notorious piece of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Sins willfully and out of choice committed upon a Sabbath are Sins in grain, Scarlet and Crimſon-ſins. To mind worldly Affairs, to ſit brooding upon worldly Thoughts, to follow the Trades and Callings of the World, to open Shops, and buy and ſell upon a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day are God-provoking Sins, acts of prophaneneſs. Theſe are lawful upon other days, in which God hath given you leave, nay more, he hath made it your Duty to labour and do all that you have
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40119:177"/> to do of this Nature, but they are very ſinful upon the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Let me propound <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to the Conſideration of Magiſtrates and Inferiour Officers, and his care and activity in this point, as an example richly worth their Imitation. Take the account of him as it is drawn up by himſelf, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.15, &amp;c. <hi>He ſaw ſome treading Wine-preſſes upon the Sabbath-day, and bringing in Sheaves, and lading Aſſes, as alſo Wine, Grapes and Figs, all manner of burdens which they brought into</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>upon the Sabbath-day; the men of</hi> Tyre <hi>alſo dwelt there who brought Fiſh and all manner of wares, and ſold on the Sabbath to the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem. This was exceeding evil, and one would wonder it ſhould be found among a people but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come back to their own Countrey out of a ſore and tedious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. Yet thus it was. But let us ſee what good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Governour did hereupon, and how he beſtir'd himſelf. <hi>He teſtified againſt them in the day whereon they ſold Victuals, and he contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Elders of</hi> Judah, <hi>and ſaid unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do and prophane the Sabbath-day? Did not your Fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon them? And yet ye bring more evil upon</hi> Iſrael <hi>by prophaning the Sabbath.</hi> And after this, <hi>He ſhut the Gates, and ſet his Servants to watch, and would not ſuffer the Merchants and Sellers of wares to lodge about the Walls, but threatned to lay hold upon them,</hi> and did not deſiſt nor give over till <hi>He had prevented their coming any more upon the Sabbath-day.</hi> Oh that there were many ſuch <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> in the World among Chriſtian Nations! Shall I gather up what this Scripture affords and ſhew you what is to be learned from it? Briefly thus. 1. Trading upon the Sabbath-day is a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prophaning of it. 2. It is ſuch a prophaning of it as is highly diſpleaſing unto God, and will bring down his wrath upon a People that are guilty. 3. It is the proper work of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, not unbecoming the Supream to puniſh and prevent it. 4. In order thereunto He will find it neceſſary to be very vigilant and active. 5. It is not enough to begin well and do ſomething, but there muſt be a going on till there be a thorow Reformation. And let not any ſay, ſuch care as this would be Judaizing, and the Goſpel brings along with it a greater Liberty, for though we have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Liberty yet not a ſinful one. We are delivered from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, which was an heavy and oppreſſing yoke, but not from the Obſervation and Obedience to the Moral Law as it is, and ſtill it is, and to the end of the World it will be a Rule of Life. And Gods <hi>abounding</hi> in his goodneſs to us, whoſe lines are caſt in New Teſtament-times is a very bad argument for an <hi>abating</hi> in our care of Sanctifying his Name and his Day.</p>
            <p>Time, my beloved, hath been when <hi>England,</hi> as well as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was famous for the ſanctifying of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and truly for theſe many years it hath been, and to this day it is as infamous for the breaking of it, and upon that account and by
<pb facs="tcp:40119:178"/> that means it hath loſt much of it's Priſtine Glory. Do you not ſee, I am ſure with grief of Heart I do, how vile and wretched Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſet forth their wares to ſale upon that Holy Day in our Fields and Streets? Do you not ſee how the Victualling and Alehouſes are frequented and filled upon that day? Do you not ſee, or at leaſt hear of Plays and Paſtimes upon that day? As if the Book of Sports were revived, and allowed. How many among us do make that their Gaming day, and their Fuddling day, which God hath made his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Day? What! Oh, What is the matter? Where doth the fault lie? We have ſomething of Law againſt this, bleſſed be God, and what, have we no Officers to put the Law that is into Execution? I earneſtly beſeech all thoſe who are concerned, as they fear God, and as they have any Affection, Good will, and kindneſs for the Land of their Nativity, that they would put on ſtrength, and appear vigorouſly on this behalf. For if you will tolerate the prophanation of the Sabbath, you can rationally Promiſe to your ſelves no other but a tremendous overflowing of wickedneſs all the Week after; it will be ſo through the Corruption of man, and the moſt righteous Judgment of God, with whom it is far from unuſual to puniſh Sin with Sin. Do but read Hiſtories, and if you have minded things, conſult your own Obſervations, and you will find that according to a peoples Holy care, or Vile neglect of keeping Holy the Sabbath-day, Religion doth flouriſh, or Wickedneſs abounds and grows rank and rampant among them. Having finiſhed the Doctrinal part, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Application, and therein direct my ſpeech to all ſorts of Perſons among us, and oh that it may be acceptable to them, and come upon their Souls with Power, that ſo there may be ſome ſtop put to theſe crying Abominations, and the wickedneſs of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among us may come to an end, and they may come over, upon this call from God, to a temperate, ſober and Religious Life, or if not ſo, yet at leaſt their wickedneſs may not make ſuch prodigious advances, nor riſe up to that height as it hath done for ſo many years, to the diſhonour and provoking of God, the grief of all good men, and almoſt the ruine of the Nation; and the pleaſing of none but a curſed Company of the Antichriſtian brood, who made it their deſign and buſineſs to introduce Popery at the door of Debauchery. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the moſt likely way, for when Perſons and a People have caſt off the fear of God and run croſs to the Principles of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they profeſs, and by leading flagitious lives, offered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their Conſciences, they are in a frame ready for the baſeſt impreſſions, and to follow that Devil who ſhall firſt tempt them; and however it comes to paſs through the all-ordering and over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Providence of a wiſe God, who, when he pleaſeth, and as he pleaſeth, chains the Sea, and reſtrains the luſts of men, ſo that though they go thus far they ſhall go no farther, I ſhall not at all wonder to ſee a Practical Atheiſt become a Doctrinal Papiſt, that ſo his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Let me not by any be counted too bold, and going out of my place, while I turn me to the great men of the Nation, and ſpeak to them as Perſons not too high for the Counſels, Commands and Exhortations of the Word of God, I mean, the King as Supream, Nobles, Gentlemen, and all under him to whom any part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this Nation is committed; and theſe, all theſe from the higheſt to the loweſt I do with all due Humility, as knowing my diſtance from many of them, yet with utmoſt earneſtneſs, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech that they would awake unto Righteouſneſs, and ſee to it that they be found faithful in their place and to their truſt, filling up every one the Province which God hath ſet them in, and trading eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one with their Talents, whether more or fewer, five or two; nay let not him that hath but one hide it in a Napkin, and bury it in ſloth, but be abounding in this work of the Lord, that through your care and induſtry Juſtice may run down among us like a Flood, and Judgment like a mighty Water, for the waſhing away that loathſome filth which is in our Streets.</p>
               <p>All that know you, may it pleaſe your moſt excellent Majeſty, know, that you have a great deal of important and weighty work continually before you, which muſt neceſſarily fill your Royal Head with Thoughts, and your Heart with Cares, that keeps your eyes wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king while others ſleep without Interruption or Diſturbance. There is abundant reaſon for us all to pity your burdens, and to pray that you may be counſelled by the God of Wiſdom, and ſupported by the God of Power, and have the Arms of your Hands made ſtrong by the Everlaſting Arms of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but no reaſon for any Proteſtant among us to envy your Honour and other Prae-eminences, which are juſt, though too ſmall recompences for the hazzards you have run, and the Kindneſs you have ſhewn, and the Thoughts, Cares, and Pains you have taken for the ſaving of a People looked upon as being within a very few ſteps of Ruine. None knows the weight of a Crown but he that wears it.

And if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. I ſhall alſo be free to ſpeak a few words to my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry, of what Judgment and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion ſoever they are, about thoſe things which have been and are matters of difference and controverſie among us. You would, all of you be received, honoured and attended unto as the Miniſters of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> My requeſt unto you is that you would approve your ſelves and convince all that you are ſuch, by your preaching <hi>Chriſt</hi> up and Sin down, all manner of Sin, all ſorts of Filthineſs, both of the Fleſh and of the Spirit. Spare none, neither ſmall nor great. Be ſure that what offends you doth offend God as well as you, and then bend your Bow and level your Arrows at it: But as for the over-grown prophaneneſs of the Age, which you cannot but know doth ſo greatly abound in the midſt of us, ſet your ſelves with all your might, not only to lop off it's luxuriant branches, but, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pull it up by the very roots. Do not, in the bowels of love I beſeech you, do not rend and tare one another, do not waſte and ſpend your precious and ſwiftly flying time, your heat and ſtrength about thoſe things which your Conſciences tell you are Adiaphorous, or Indifferent, and ſome of you have by Word of Mouth and in your writings owned and acknowledged to be ſo; and a zealous contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them and ſtiff upholding of them will break the Peace both of Church and State, as it hath done ever ſince the beginning of the Reformation, but will never afford you ſolid Comfort and a well-grounded Peace, when you come to lie upon a Death-bed, and the King of Terrours with his grim and gaſtly countenance ſhall look you in the face. But labour with might and main againſt that root of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40119:179"/> bitterneſs, prophaneneſs, which, if you know any thing as you ought to know, you cannot but know is of a damnable Nature, and will, if not prevented and heartily repented of, caſt and ſink particular Perſons into the bottomleſs pit of Eternal Perdition, and alſo bring ruine upon an whole Nation, ſo that though <hi>Noah, Samuel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſhould ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and plead for them, yet his mind could not be toward them.</p>
               <p>Do not you admit to the Table of your Lord filthy Swine that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Mire of all prophaneneſs. Swearers, Drunkards, and others of that black guard do not look like gueſts meet for ſuch a Solemnity, not like ſuch as the Holy Jeſus will bid welcome. Do not you ſeal to them an Intereſt in all the Bleſſings of that Covenant which they wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly violate, nor in the ſaving benefits of that moſt precious Blood, which was indeed ſhed for Sinners, but is by them trampled under foot as if it were an unholy thing, and had purchaſed for them a lawleſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or Licenſe to be Unholy. Do not you receive them to a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Ordinance, who run with the herd, and are not by their lives and actions diſtinguiſhed from the worſt and vileſt. Remember that old ſaying, and very good one, <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> Holy things for holy Perſons. And conſider what our Lord ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth.</hi> He will have his Servants ſever the good and the bad, giving his Promiſes and Seals to the former, denying them to the latter. He will have his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards to be faithful, feaſting his Children with the dainties of his Houſe, but not throwing them away to Dogs, and thoſe that do ſo He will own. Thus do ye, and by ſo doing you will come forth to the help of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate againſt thoſe mighty abominations which Domineer and Reign among us. Conſidering the place you are in, and that ſolemn work you have engaged in, one would expect that all of you ſhould be holy, not only by Dedication, but by a real inward Sanctification, at leaſt of unblameable Converſations, free from ſcandal, being without offence though not before God, yet before men. A prophane wicked Miniſter is a groſs Soleciſm, and deſerves to be counted a monſter, and to be driven from among men as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was when brutified, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25.</p>
               <p>But while you do ſhine with the bright beams of Holineſs, and walk according to the bleſſed <hi>Rules</hi> of the everlaſting Goſpel, which you ought to preach, you may boldly and comfortably without any ſevere gripes within &amp; without any reproaches caſt upon you from without bend your utmoſt force againſt thoſe extravagants who walk contrary <hi>to them.</hi> Therefore, my Brethren, let us all ſtudy the Goſpel we preach, and live it as well as know it, for knowledge will not be ſaving until it influence Heart and Life, and be reduced into practice: Let us I ſay think with our ſelves, and repeat the thought often and often, what manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we ought to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs, and then may we lift up our voices like Trumpets, and decry all the wickedneſs we know to be acted. Herein will you do ſingularly good ſervice both to the great God in Heaven, and to our King and Magiſtrates upon Earth, and to the whole Land. We read that in the fight with <hi>Amalek,</hi> while
<pb facs="tcp:40119:180"/> 
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in the valley, <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the mount with the <hi>Rod of God</hi> in his hand, which he lifted up. And when his hands were weary, and ready to flag, <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were by to ſuſtain and uphold them. <hi>Aaron</hi> was the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Lord, and <hi>Hur</hi> was a Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Let this example teach all their duty, and excite and quicken them to the performance of it. When the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Supream Magiſtrate I mean, is lifted up with the rod of God againſt the Sins of the times, let both <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> Magiſtrates and Miniſters come in chearfully and ſtrenuouſly to his aſſiſtance. For it is a thouſand pities that the Magiſtrate ſhould work alone, when ſet about ſo great and good a work as this. Do you back him, and afford unto him all the Aſſiſtance that you can.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. I ſhall now in the laſt place direct my diſcourſe unto thoſe who are placed in a lower Sphere, for the preſent, not put into any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nor clothed with any thing of Magiſtratical Power and Authority, but altogether in a private capacity. I would have you to conſider what you have to do. For there is a Duty incumbent upon every one. Though you are not to reach out your hands to works or acts of Office neither in the State nor in the Church, yet you are not to lay aſide nor neglect any part of that work which belongs to you as members of both. And as there is not the leaſt and meaneſt Perſon in a Kingdom but may do a great deal of miſchief, ſo there is not the meaneſt but if he have an Heart may do ſome good. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.14, 15. of a little City that had but few men, and was beſieged by a great King. And there was found in it a <hi>Poor man,</hi> who by his Wiſdom deliver'd the City. And in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. When <hi>Sheba</hi> roſe up in Rebellion againſt <hi>David,</hi> and being purſu'd went to <hi>Abel, Joab</hi> with his Hoſt, caſt up a bank againſt it, and batter'd the wall, but a <hi>Woman</hi> ſaved it from ruine. Every one may be inſtrumental for good. Since it is, then, the Duty of Magiſtrates from the higheſt to the loweſt to act what they can toward the ſuppreſſion of prophaneneſs, there are theſe two things unto which I would exhort you who are in private ſtations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Set an high value and eſteem upon every one of thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates whom you know or hear to be herein true to their truſt, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perform their duty. You may be ſure of this that they will find diſcouragement enough &amp; oppoſition from the ranting crew. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked themſelves, at whoſe luſts they ſtrike, will hate them with an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred, and curſe them, and drink to their confuſion, and with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire to be rid of them, and do whatever they can in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. I do not wonder to hear of the plottings and combinations both of Atheiſts and Papiſts in ſuch a caſe. There is nothing that they hate more than Reformation and Religion, nothing they will be more impatient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than a reſtraint laid upon their luſts. Therefore thoſe that are pious and ſober, that fear God, and are friends to the Nation ſhould be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dear over them, and prize them at an high rate, and love them with their hearts, and honour them, and willingly pay Tribute, and bleſs God for them. We are leſs than the leaſt of mercies and ought to own them, much more greater Mercies. A good Servant in a Family is a bleſſing to it.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40119:180"/> 
                  <hi>Laban</hi> confeſt it to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 30.27. <hi>I have learned by experience that the Lord hath bleſſed me for thy ſake.</hi> How great a Bleſſing then is a good King upon the Throne, a good Lord-Mayor in the Chair, good Juſtices upon the Bench! Certainly theſe are Bleſſings with all thankfulneſs to be owned, they are mercies, among temporal ones, of the firſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they do make an happy Nation and an happy People, unleſs that People will be ſo vile and froward as to ſtand in the way of their own happineſs. Thoſe that are Proteſtants in their Hearts, who while they verbally profeſs that Religion are ſincere in that Profeſſion, cannot but with delight look upon it as a choice and ſingular Mercy for our gracious God (in a day wherein there were great ſearchings &amp; ſinkings of heart) to ſet over us our King and Queen, <hi>a Proteſtant King and Queen,</hi> whoſe hearts, we perſwade our ſelves, are ſet for the Maintenance of the true Reformed Religion, and we hope for the pulling down whatſoever is contrary and bids defiance thereunto in its Principles and Precepts. Love them for this, let them be our dear as well as our dread Sovereigns. and let us be ſure to be ſubject to them, not only for wrath, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for Conſcience ſake, yea, and out of choice. And let us pray for them, and plead for them, and ſtrive both together and apart with God for them, and bring down upon them from Heaven all the Bleſſings we can. This was done by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20. <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble. The name of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>defend thee, ſend thee help from the Sanctuary and ſtrengthen thee out of</hi> Zion. <hi>Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt offerings, Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counſels, and hear thee from his Holy Heaven with the ſaving ſtrength of his right hand.</hi> Thus they did bleſs their King in his Exploits, and thus let us bleſs our King in his. Yea, let the bleſſing of <hi>Joſeph</hi> come upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.25, 26. <hi>Let the Almighty bleſs him with the bleſſings of Heaven above, and bleſſings of the deep that lieth under, bleſſings of the Breaſts and of the Womb, let his bleſſings prevail above the bleſſings of all his Progenitors, unto the utmoſt bounds of the everlaſting hills, let them be upon his head, and the head of his deareſt Conſort.</hi> For I hope, time will make it further evident that He is a ſingular Inſtrument raiſed up by God for the effecting of great and glorious things in the world, and for the Church of Chriſt, which hath been in ſo many Places for ſo many Years afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted. Yea, that he is deſigned for an Avenger to execute wrath upon him and them, who have been the Plague of the Chriſtian World, and have made it their work and delight to deſtroy the Earth, and their deſign to erect to themſelves a Monument of Glory out of the Ruins of Kingdoms, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let me deſire you to facilitate the work of Magiſtrates, and make it as eaſie to them as you can. You that are Maſters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, having Children and Servants under you, and underſtand your work, and deſire to go through with it, find, that you have enough to do in your narrow and little ſpheres, your ſmall Cock-boats call for much care and pains. We that are <hi>Paſtors</hi> of Churches, have a great
<pb facs="tcp:40119:181"/> deal more, e'en ſo much as makes our Heads and Hearts to ake, and we cry out with holy <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> People do little think thoſe many thoughts which gracious and faithful Miniſters have both day and night, the multitude of thoſe cares which they take the burdens which often lie upon their Spirits, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bitter ſighs and groans which upon various accounts they do utter in their private receſſes when they are alone with <hi>God.</hi> But yet, what is this, all this, to that load which lieth upon the ſhoulders of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who ſits as <hi>Pilot</hi> at the Helm of ſo great a Ship, and upon whom cometh daily, not only the care of Three Kingdoms, but, as doubtleſs I may ſafely add, of the whole Proteſtant Intereſt, which hath been ſo deſperately ſtruck at; yea, and of all the Churches who have felt the fury of Oppreſſors, that have put yokes of iron upon their necks. And not only the King, whoſe Place is higheſt, and Province hardeſt; but others alſo who are employed by and under him, do find they have enough to do. The Lord Mayor, the Juſtices of Peace, the Petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, Beadles, Watchmen have enough to do. How many avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have they from their own Callings and particular Affairs, which for their own and Families good muſt be attended to, and how many Troubles and Vexations have they in the management of their Places? I would therefore prevail with you to pity them and to help them, and to take off from their burden all that you can. This will be an argument of your being acted by a Spirit truly Chriſtian, and it doth very well become all good Subjects.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jethro,</hi> the Father-in-Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> came to the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and ſaw all that <hi>Moſes</hi> did to the People, He ſpake thus to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Thou wilt ſurely wear away,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the thing is too heavy for thee, thou art not able to perform it thy ſelf alone.</hi> So I ſay, Our <hi>King</hi> will wear away, He is but a Man, His Strength is not the ſtrength of Stones, nor is his Fleſh of Braſs. He is made of fleſh and blood as well as others, and is ſubject to the ſame infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, decays and ſtrokes that others are, and truly his life deſerves to be exceeding precious in our eyes, He is the breath of our Noſtrils, and our Life and Peace, our Comfort and Happineſs is very much bound up in him. And therefore we have, and I hope we ſhall more and more ſee that we have a great deal of reaſon to contribute all that we can to the lengthening out of his days, and making his life comfortable. But the weight of Government is too heavy for him, I mean, as good old <hi>Jethro</hi> did, He is not able to perform it himſelf <hi>alone.</hi> To deal with <hi>England</hi>'s enraged Enemies abroad, and with <hi>England</hi>'s daring Sins at home is too much for him alone; nay, may I not go farther? It is too much for his Privy Council and Parliament too; yea, and for all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Magiſtrates and Officers too. Take them altogether, and it is too much for them alone.</p>
               <p>I do therefore earneſtly beſeech you all to put your helping hand to the work, and yield them all the aſſiſtance that you can. We have, as my Experience and conſtant Obſervation tells me, a Spirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40119:181"/> and complaining very buſie and active, though indeed often times not without too much cauſe: And the Lord grant, thoſe who are now our Rulers may have ſuch a Spirit of Wiſdom and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment plentifully poured out from Heaven upon them that they may never give good Men any, that thoſe who have an Intereſt in God, and will certainly be heard at the Throne of Grace, may never be conſtrained to go with their juſt Complaints. But how many are there that do without cauſe fill their mouths with Complaints, and call thoſe faults which are not, and throw dirt in the faces of Perſons in place? But I will ask this one queſtion, what do theſe Complainers do in order to the amending of that which is amiſs? Our Streets would be clearer than they are, if every one would ſweep before his own Door. And Reformation would happily become Univerſal, if every one would be a Self-Reformer. And oh that you would be ſo! Oh that others would be ſo! Oh that all would ſay what <hi>Elihu</hi> doth in <hi>Job</hi> tell us is meet to be ſaid unto God, <hi>What I know not, teach thou me, and if I have done iniquity I will do ſo no more.</hi> I ſhall yet divide this my Exhortation into two branches.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſpeak unto thoſe who are Governours of Families, and have Children and Servants under their inſpection, apply to your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there. Would you gladly ſee all things well abroad, as far as you can, every one of you take care that they be ſo at home. You that are Parents, muſt know and conſider that that God who gave you Children, hath committed to you the care and charge of their Souls. And you that have Apprentices, ought likewiſe to know and conſider, that the Souls as well as the Bodies of your Apprentices are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your care by their Parents or Friends, and are your charge like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And the ſame is true as to your other menial Servants, ſo long as they ſhall continue under your Roof as ſuch: and accordingly you are under a ſtrict Obligation for looking after them. That is not a thing which you may do or leave undone, as you pleaſe; but you are bound to it. You ought to be their keepers, for you are reſponſible for them. And if thorough your neglect and careleſsneſs any of them do eternally miſcarry, they will die in their Sins, but their blood will be required at your hands.</p>
               <p>Whereas your holy care as to them will be very pleaſing &amp; acceptable unto God, as is clear from his former dealings in this very caſe. He took this ſo kindly at the hand of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that upon the account thereof he would reveal unto him his purpoſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17. <hi>The Lord ſaid, Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>the thing which I do?</hi> Shall I not communicate my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſhall I do ſuch a Work as I am now reſolved upon, and not let <hi>Abraham</hi> know it? But why did the Lord ask ſuch a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? why might he not hide that, or any thing elſe from him or another, if he pleaſed, being <hi>Agens liberrimum,</hi> a moſt free Agent, and giving no account of his Matters? But what was the reaſon of this his ſo great condeſcention? Or, what was <hi>Abraham,</hi> that God's Cabinet-Council ſhould be as to any one particular unlocked and open'd unto
<pb facs="tcp:40119:182"/> him? God himſelf gives two reaſons of it, one in the 18th Verſe, <hi>Seeing</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhall ſurely become a great and mighty Nation, and all the Nations in the Earth ſhall be bleſſed in him.</hi> I have promiſed him great Mercies and Bleſſings, ſuch as I have not promiſed to any man beſides in the whole world, and ſhall I after that conceal this from him which is a great deal leſs? but the other reaſon to which I now refer you, followeth in the 19th Verſe, <hi>for I know him, that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> I know him, I am ſure he is my Friend, He loves me dearly, His heart is ſet for my honour and intereſt, He will commend me and my way to all that are under his charge, and He will lay his Command upon them to love, fear and ſerve me, and keep my way. God will manifeſt himſelf unto, and ſet a ſpecial mark of favour upon thoſe that are ſtudious of promoting and poſteritizing Religion and the Worſhip of God in their Families. Theſe are Men and Women according to his Heart.</p>
               <p>Will you then ſtudy &amp; heartily apply to your Duty to this purpoſe? will you teach your Children and Servants the good knowledge and fear of the Lord? Labour to inſtil betimes into them right Principles, and be dropping as they are capable of receiving. Will you be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking and ſpurring them on to their Duty by your warm Counſels and Exhortations? will you lay your ſtrict Commands upon them to do it as they would have your love and avoid your diſpleaſure. Allure them by your own example, that is a ſtrong ſilken Cord which draws ſweetly. The way to have them write well, is for you to ſet them good Copies. Oh let them not ſee Irreligion in you, and Prophaneſs in you, for an hundred to one but if they do, that will do them more miſchief than all your Precepts and Counſels will do them good. Are you in good earneſt when you tell them you would have them good? then take care that you be good your ſelves. Be ſure to ſet up and keep up in your Families the Worſhip of God. There were indeed Saints in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Houſe, and an <hi>Ahijah</hi> in <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s, in whom there was ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Hoſts, who can make Flowers grow in Dunghils and Wilderneſſes, as well as Springs of Water in Deſerts, but theſe are Rarities, there is no great reaſon to expect them, ſuch ſoils do not uſually afford them. Therefore do you worſhip God, and Pray with your Families Morning and Evening, a Duty I fear too much neglected by ſome who know better; follow you the pattern of good <hi>Joſhua</hi> in that excellent reſolution, that <hi>He and his houſe would ſerve the Lord,</hi> not He alone, nor they alone, but all in a Conjunction. Company is comfortable and deſirable in that which is good. Keep a watchful eye upon them, do not truſt them with themſelves, for the Scripture tells you that Childhood and Youth are Vanity, and that Folly is bound up in the hearts of young ones; there is an whole pack of folly in them, and if you do not look to them, they will both add to the pack and open it. They bring into the world with them a great deal of corruption, and that is juſt like Tinder and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40119:182"/> Touchwood, that will quickly catch and be fired by thoſe ſparks of Temptation which fly up and down thick in the World. Give unto them all the encouragement that is fit for them. Children ſhould have ingenuous and liberal Education, and Servants not be uſed like ſlaves, not diſpirited and diſcouraged, chid and beaten into Mopes. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand mingled with kindneſs and love will be found to do beſt and go furtheſt; but never let looſe the Reins of Government, hold them ſtrait, for where too much liberty is given, a great deal more will be taken, by which means, if there be not care taken to prevent it, that liberty will ſoon degenerate into licentiouſneſs, for it borders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it already. I beſeech you therefore, Fathers and Maſters, Mothers and Miſtreſſes, ſtudy you to be good in your places: And ſince you are to govern other, be ſure rightly to govern your ſelves. National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation will eaſily follow when Family-Reformation leads the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhall direct my Exhortation to particular perſons, every one of you to whom I now ſpeak, and every one of thoſe to whom this diſcourſe ſhall come, from the higheſt to the loweſt, of what rank and quality ſoever they are, and in what place and ſtation ſoever the hand of Divine Providence hath ſet them. It is not ſo much matter what you are for greatneſs, as what you are for goodneſs; not ſo much in what Orb you are fixed (if we may ſpeak of ſuch a thing as a fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a tumbling and rolling world) as with what beams you ſhine. I beſeech you all, one and other to look to your ſelves, and be very circumſpect and careful of your ſelves, what you are, what you do, and how you carry in the world. Every man is charged with himſelf; though not only with himſelf, yet with himſelf; every man is to give an account of himſelf to God. None of you are ſo high as to be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable. It is your unqueſtionable Duty to keep your hearts with all diligence, and to ponder the Path of your feet. You ought to be conſiderate men, and curious and exact, and to weigh things propounded to you before you cloſe with them, and actions before you do them.</p>
               <p>Will you be perſwaded to apply to this Duty? will you do it? will you walk circumſpectly, accurately, not as Fools, but as Wiſe, not as Beaſts but as Men, not as Heathen-men, but as Chriſtians, as thoſe that have been under Goſpel Divine teachings? will you endeavour to lead ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as becomes thoſe who do really believe there is a God, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life and State after this, a Reſurrection from the Dead, a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Heaven and an Hell, unſpeakable Glory and Happineſs for them that obey the Goſpel, and conform themſelves to the Law and Rule of the new Creature, an everlaſting ſhame, contempt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thoſe that are workers of iniquity. Know ſuch a life hath admirable delights to ſweeten it in the way, and inconceivable rewards to Crown it in the end. I earneſtly beſeech you to propound ſuch ſerious and weighty Queſtions as theſe to your ſelves, when you do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feel the ſtirrings and motions of Sin, or are aſſaulted by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to it from without. Doth ſuch an action become me? whether will it contribute to or detract from my honour, intereſt or comfort?
<pb facs="tcp:40119:183"/> Is a life of Debauchery and Prophaneſs worthy of a man that hath an immortal Soul, and do expect when I die and leave this World to launch into the Ocean of Eternity? would I have my Lord, when he cometh, find me ſo doing? Is not this that I am now inticed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to contrary to the Law and end of my Creation, to the Goſpel-Law, and to the dictates of right reaſon? will this be for my advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage either now or hereafter? if this be the Seed I ſow, what will be the Harveſt that I ſhall reap? will Sin ever pay me for the coſt I am at upon it, and for the pains that I take about it? the Scripture tells us the wages it gives its Servants are Death, and what Wiſe Man will do hard Work for no better Wages? Suppoſe that it doth afford pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pleaſure that tickles a vain carnal mind, will that pleaſure laſt? Is there not a Sting to follow that honey, will it not be bitterneſs in the latter end? Certainly it will iſſue in ſhame and ſorrow. And who will chooſe to walk in that way, though it be a Carpet one, that will go down to and lodge the Traveller at laſt in the Chambers of Death, and the Bed of Flames?</p>
               <p>As for thoſe of you who have hitherto been vain and looſe and wicked, and God knows there are too many of you, do not ſtop your Ears to the Voice of the Charmers, do not, oh, do not hate to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. It is better for you to break off your Sins by a timely and ſpeedy repentance, than to go on, becauſe none of you can tell but the very next ſtep that you take you may tumble into Hell, ſince every ſtep in Sins way takes hold of it. What <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore ſaid to that proud and haughty Monarch <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel</hi> 4.27. I will ſay to you, <hi>Let my counſel be acceptable to you, break off your ſins by righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and your iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your tranquilli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y;</hi> or, as you have it in the Margin of your Bibles, <hi>an healing of your errour.</hi> If every one would mend one, how ſoon ſhould we ſee a lovely face and excellent beauty upon the whole! nay, if the generality or major part of the Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> would be prevailed with to come over to a Sober and Religious Life, if Princes, Nobles and Gentlemen will be exemplary therein, Sin and Debauchery would learn to abate ſomething of its Impudence, and grow more modeſt than it is. In ſtead of walking up and down with a brazen face at Noon-day in our Streets, as it hath done, it would ſeek Corners, and hide it ſelf under the covert of darkneſs, as in the <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtles</hi> times, <hi>when they that were drunk were drunk in the night,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.7. Now that I might promote in all Perſons, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Spheres and Capacities, a conſciencious care and endeavour to ſuppreſs Prophaneneſs, I ſhall cloſe this Diſcourſe with theſe few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Pray for ſome of Chriſt's Eye ſalve, that your Eyes being thereby open'd, you may ſee the uglineſs and deformity of Prophaneneſs. Do not give credit to that report which Sin makes of it ſelf, no, nor to theirs neither who are its ſworn Slaves and Vaſſals. For what true Information can you expect to receive from them, who are under the power of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40119:183"/> ſtrong deluſions, who are ſelf-deceived and have their minds blinded by the God of this World, and run away with a lye in their right hand? But do you ſit down and take the Word of God for your guide and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, and from thence your meaſures, and ſeriouſly conſider, what beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can there be in that which hath defaced the whole creation, that was at firſt a moſt exquiſite and curious piece, and every thing in it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good? What excellency can there be after the moſt diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry found in that, which is in itſelf contrary to the beſt and Supream good, and makes every thing elſe ſo that is ſo? What deſirableneſs can there be in that from whence have come all thoſe ſtings with which man is tormented, and all the poiſons by which he is indanger'd?</p>
               <p>Oh! That you could look upon it with ſuch an eye as the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe and holy God doth, and then I am ſure you would ſee it to be out of meaſure ſinful, and ſo hate it with a perfect hatred, and flee from it more than from the Devil, for it made him what he is, and is worſe than He, who had it not been for ſin, would ſtill have continued a glorious Angel. Oh that you would take a view of it as it is repreſented to you in the Glaſs of Scripture precepts, which do expreſly forbid it, and in the glaſs of Scripture-threatnings which are moſt dreadfully thundered out againſt it, and in the Glaſs of thoſe many tremendous and amazing Judgments which have been executed up and down in the world, by which God hath reveal'd his wrath from Heaven againſt all the ungodlineſs, unrighteouſneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of men, ſparing neither People nor Princes, but hanging up ſome of both ſorts, as it were in Chains, that they might be for the admonition and warning of them that do ſurvive. Once more, look upon it in the Glaſs of our <hi>Saviours</hi> blood, which had never been ſhed, no not a drop of it, had it not been for ſin, but that cauſed the ſhedding of it all, even his Heart, Life Blood. And it was abſolutely neceſſary, according to the divine determination in order to mans Salvation, that it ſhould be ſo, for <hi>without the ſhedding of bloud there would have been no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. Had not the blood of <hi>Jeſus, God-man</hi> been ſhed, and made Satisfaction, as a propitiatory Sacrifice to Divine juſtice infinitely provoked by the Sin of man, the offence and diſpleaſure cauſed by ſin would have to all everlaſting remained without any hope or, as far as we know, any poſſibility of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. The leaſt ſin is ſuch an <hi>anomy</hi> or tranſgreſſion of the divine Law, ſuch an affront to the Divine Majeſty, gives ſuch a blow at the Soveraignty and Government of God, and carrieth in it ſo much of malignity and provocation that there needs no more than it to ſink the guilty perſon into the bottomleſs pit of endleſs miſery; I leave it then to you to conſider, what there is in that prophaneneſs, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs number of God-daring abominations which are to be found in the midſt of us. In ſhort, this is that which I propound and deſire of you, judge of ſin by its utter contrariety to the great holy and ever bleſſed God, and by the ſufferings of Chriſt who was his peoples ſurety, and died a Sacrifice, the iniquities of them all being laid upon him,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:184"/> and by the fatal conſequences of ſin upon men and Devils, yea upon the whole world, upon the face whereof it hath thrown dirt and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and in the bowels whereof it hath cauſed Afflictive, Painful Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Convulſions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Be ſure that all of you get your hearts filled and awed with the true fear of God. In which you ought and are commanded <hi>to be all the day, Prov.</hi> 23.17. Lye down at night in it, awake and riſe in the morning in it, and ſo walk up and down in all Places and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and about all your buſineſſes and affairs. No perſons in the world are ſo audaciouſly and impudently vile as thoſe who have their hearts hardned from this fear. That paſſage is very obſervable which you find in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith within my heart, there is no fear of God before his Eyes.</hi> Sin hath a voice, it cries aloud in the Ears of God, and it ſpeaks loud to men, to the hearts of good men. It ſpeaks that which grieves and ſaddens them, it ſpeaks that which informs them. So here. The tranſgreſſion of the wicked, his viſible and open tranſgreſſion, the life he leads, which is flagitious, the courſe he takes which is Leud, the Villanies he commits, theſe ſpeak within my heart, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> they ſpeak to my mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but what do they ſay? Enough, ſo much as amounts to a plain and full evidence, ſo much as is to me a ſufficient and firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build this concluſion upon, that there is no fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes. Either he doth not believe that there is a God, or elſe he believes that he is not a terrible God, a Conſuming Fire, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings, but ſuch an one as himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. A God not to be trembled before, but to be trifled and plaid with. One that did not mind what is done here below, or that hath pleaſure in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he hath himſelf.</p>
               <p>What was the reaſon that <hi>Abraham,</hi> though a good man, eminently good and ſtrong in faith, yet, was not willing to have it publickly known that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his Wife when he ſojourned in <hi>Gerar?</hi> You have the account thereof given in <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.12. <hi>I thought ſurely, the fear of God is not in this place.</hi> Here is not the worſhip of God, therefore here is not the fear of God; but what did he gather from thence? What if there be not the fear of God? Then there is the fear of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they will ſtick at nothing, they will have their will, <hi>they will ſtay me for my Wifes ſake.</hi> This is indeed a ſweet Place, a lovely and pleaſant Countrey, it wants for no earthly accommodations, but, as I Conjecture, and that not without reaſon, the beſt and principal thing is wanting, here is none of the fear of God, and where there is not that curb to reſtrain men, they will certainly run wild, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous luſts will hurry them into the vileſt and moſt monſtrous practices, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi non eſt timor Dei, ibi regnant omnia vitia.</hi> All vices reign and rage in thoſe places where the fear of God hath not a commanding power. Whereas on the other ſide, no perſons do hate and oppoſe ſin ſo much as thoſe who do fear God moſt, for this is that which doth teach men, and that effectually, to depart from evil. Former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40119:184"/> did ſo and ſo, but ſaid good <hi>Nehemiah, ſo did not I, becauſe of the fear of God.</hi> There was none like <hi>Job</hi> in all earth, and it is ſaid of him by the Lord himſelf that <hi>he feared God and eſchewed evil.</hi> He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided and reſiſted it. This fear will ſet the heart of a man againſt ſin, and conſtrain him to lift up his hand againſt it, or his voice at leaſt, when there is not any power in his hand. Whereſoever there is the fear of God as the greateſt and beſt good, there will inſeparably accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it the fear of ſin as the baſeſt and worſt of evils, and that perſon will be ſure to make an univerſal oppoſition to it whereſoever it is to be found, both in himſelf and in others, at home and abroad, in enemies and in Friends too, yea in them moſt. As a man that hath a natural an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to a Viper cannot endure it lying in his boſom, nor lurking in his Chamber, no, nor creeping in the high-way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Pray that your Souls may be fill'd and fix'd with an holy zeal for God. A zeal for his name, and honour, for his Law and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Cold, Lukewarm and baſely indifferent perſons will never be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned upon the account of any vigorous appearings for God or againſt ſin. A ſordid Spirit of indifferency (greatly unworthy of every one that is honoured with the Chriſtian name) doth evermore carry along with it a Spirit of Slothfulneſs and Inactivity, let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be never ſo important, the concern never ſo great. In <hi>Acts</hi> 18. you read that the blind and hardned <hi>Jews</hi> with one accord made inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> took <hi>Soſthenes</hi> the Apoſtles Friend and Companion, and beat him before the Judgment Seat, but <hi>Gallio</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd neither againſt the one nor the other. <hi>He cared for none of thoſe things.</hi> He thought, what were thoſe things to him? I believe this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit influenceth, and acts many, a great many among us. God is greatly diſhonoured, his name is taken in vain, his precious Sabbaths are openly and wickedly prophaned, Religion ſuffers in its honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the Nation is indanger'd and expoſed to the diſmal effects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine indignation, young ones are corrupted, perverted, and drawn aſide to their deſtruction, and wrath is pulling down apace; and who can tell how ſoon a holy, jealous, provoked God may unſtop his vials, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſorrows in his anger? But what is all this to them ſo long as they can follow their callings, and enjoy themſelves, and gratify their proud, vain, wanton humours, and go fine and fare well, and lay up money, and live in quiet, and mirth and plenty? But let me be believed by you whileſt I tell you, that if there were in you a zeal for the honour and intereſt of God, you would judge and conclude that this is ſomething to you, and this concerns you, and accordingly it would go to your very hearts, and be as a Sword in your bones, as it was in the holy Prophet's, which extorted from him that paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation; <hi>Is it not enough for you to weary men, but you will weary my God a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſo?</hi> It was this holy zeal that put <hi>Eleazar</hi> upon that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick act of taking ſuch ſpeedy revenge as he did upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi.</hi> God himſelf took notice of it, and imputed it to his zeal, and was highly pleaſed with it, and mention'd it twice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.11. <hi>He was zealous
<pb facs="tcp:40119:185"/> for my ſake among them.</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>He was zealous for his God.</hi> His heart did burn within him, he was all in a flame, and could not with any patience endure to ſee his God ſo unworthily dealt with and diſhonoured. While I am writing of this I am informed of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent precept againſt the prophaning of the Lords day, ſent out by the Right Honourable, Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> our preſent Lord Mayor, which being of a more than ordinary ſtrain I look not upon as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of cuſtom, but an effect of his zeal, and let it be for his honour to ſucceeding generations, and an embalming of his name, and let <hi>God</hi> himſelf remember it for good to him both in time and to eternity. One thing more.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Frequently &amp; ſeriouſly call to mind that account which you are at the laſt and great day to give of your ſelves, and your power, and all your actions to a better, greater and higher than any of you, even to God himſelf. He will, for certain, he will call you all to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, therefore awe and quicken your Souls with the thoughts of it. It is but a little, very little time that the youngeſt and ſtrongeſt of you have to ſpend in the World; Death will certainly come and ſummon you hence. And when it comes it will not ſtay for you, till you have mended faults, and ſupplied defects, poſſibly it will not allow you time enough to ſay, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me.</hi> And then your places will know you no more, and your power will know you no more, and your comforts and enjoyments will know you no more. You that now ſit upon thrones and in Parliament-houſes and Courts of Judicature muſt then ſtand before the divine Tribunal upon an equal level with the meaneſt of the people, &amp; everyone of you give an account of himſelf to God, &amp; of his truſt &amp; power, &amp; how he did carry himſelf, and manage and improve his power. And therefore if you have any kindneſs for your ſelves, make it appear by your care ſo to live now, ſo to act and rule, as that you may give up a good account with boldneſs and comfort, and hear the Judge ſay, Well done, good and faithful Servants, you have been faithful in your little, you have done your duty, and fill'd up your places, now enter into the joy of your Lord. I ſhall conclude this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>We muſt all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore the terrour of the Lord we perſwade men,</hi> ſo to live in the World, ſo to order their Converſations, ſo to trade with thoſe talents of intereſt and eſtates, of parts and power for the preſent, that then they may be found faultleſs and preſented with exceeding joy.</p>

            <p>IN the Text choſen for me to ſpeak of, and for you to hear, I do obſerve, and would have you alſo conſider, we meet with a Concourſe of people who pretended to be the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of that Age; and for ought I do diſcern, may as well deſerve the Character, as they do in our Age who ſpend their time in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into uſeleſs Novelties.</p>
            <p>If our Learned Men equal the Learning of theſe <hi>Athenians.</hi> If Students from Foreign parts flock to us to perfect their courſe of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as to <hi>Athens?</hi> If Merchants in equal Numbers, but with unequal Riches, attend the Cuſtom-houſes, and fill the Exchanges with us as with them? If there were ſome Travellers who came onely to ſee, and talk, who were the (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) Strangers there? If each ſort had buſineſs of greater Importance to mind than to ſpend their time in hearing what others could tell, or telling what others would be pleas'd with hearing; which was the Folly, and Diſtemper of thoſe <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Strangers;</hi> the ſame is the <hi>Epidemical</hi> Folly and Diſeaſe of our Age, and of all ſorts of the <hi>Beaux-Eſprits,</hi> refineder Spirits with us. The Cure of this Diſeaſe is the deſign of this Diſcourſe in this Caſe:
<q>How may we Enquire after News, not as <hi>Athenians</hi> but as Chriſtians; for the better management of our Prayers and Praiſes for the Church of God?</q>
            </p>
            <p>He that Enquires to ſatisfie his Curioſity, or his ſinful Prejudices, or malicious Wiſhes, and to boaſt and triumph in the Sorrows of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:40119:186"/> of God; and He that Enquires not at all, nor concerneth himſelf with theſe Works of God, do both highly offend.</p>
            <p>The one rejoyce in the Deſtruction of <hi>Sion,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Obad.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> The other is at Eaſe in <hi>Sion, Amos</hi> 6.1. and are not grieved at the Affliction of <hi>Joſeph, Amos</hi> 6.6. and each do provoke the diſpleaſure of the Lord againſt themſelves. <hi>Amos</hi> pronounceth a Wo againſt the one, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1. and an utter Extirpation is threatned againſt the other, <hi>Obad.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> Such careleſs ones as neither fear the Evil, nor hope for the Good of <hi>Sion;</hi> neither pray for its Deliverance, nor do praiſe God for his Salvation to <hi>Sion,</hi> greatly Sin and are likely to be deeply Puniſhed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.9, 10, 11, 12. That we may Eſcape both, the Caſe warns us Not to Enquire <hi>Athenian-like,</hi> but to Enquire as becomes Chriſtians, and ſuitably Pray for a Diſtreſſed, or Praiſe God for a Delivered Church.</p>
            <p>In ſtating this unuſual Caſe, it will I think be beſt to draw it out into ſome previous Propoſitions, which ſhall make way for the clearer Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Caſuiſt doth grant that in ſome Caſes we may Enquire what is the News that is abroad.</hi> Whoſoever asketh Direction how to do an Action is firſt perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of the thing he would do. <hi>How ſhall I come before God?</hi> implieth that I may, yea ought to come before him, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.6. So here the Caſuiſt is of opinion we may Enquire, but is ſolicitous leſt you ſhould with the moſt enquire amiſs, and therefore would direct you the beſt way of doing what is lawful to be done. If there were a doubt, the Caſe ſhould be firſt, May it be done? not, How is it to be done?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>News which ſpreads abroad in the World is of very different Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some Trifling Reports,</hi> below the gravity and prudence of a Man to receive from a Reporter, or to communicate to any Hearer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Others of a very particular, private, perſonal Concern;</hi> and among ſuch as are of mean and abject ſtate, which as they riſe among them ſo 'tis fit they ſhould die amongſt them; or if reported are of no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to a Judge or Magiſtrate or the Publick, than a Counter-ſcuffle of Boys in their Sports to a General and his Army.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There are other News of a Publick Nature, and which concern the State or Church;</hi> which import ſome threatning danger, or ſome ſmiling Providence; the approaches of ſomewhat more than ordinary for the Good of Mankind or the Church of Chriſt. Such was the News of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he was <hi>alive, Lord of Egypt,</hi> and that he had ſent to fetch <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family (the Church of God in that day) to preſerve a Seed alive. Such was the News of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s coming to the Throne, favouring the <hi>Jews,</hi> and iſſuing out the Edict of their Return, which made the <hi>Jews</hi> (Dreamers like) think 'twas too Good to be true. Or when ſad News alarms the World, as when Rumors of Wars come one upon another, and threaten the World with an univerſal Deluge of Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſuch Caſes,</hi> 'tis yet conſiderable,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How certain,</hi> or how <hi>dubious</hi> the reports are which we hear.</p>
            <pb n="401" facs="tcp:40119:186"/>
            <p>
               <hi>How near at hand,</hi> or how <hi>far off</hi> the Effects are which attend the Good or bad News we hear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How likely 'tis the evil may be diverted,</hi> leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>How probable,</hi> or <hi>ſure the hoped Good</hi> accompanying the Providences of God in ſuch Caſes is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of ſuch like News this Caſe ſpeaketh; Tydings which do import great Good or great Evil to the Church of God, call upon every Member of the Church to Enquire into.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In ſuch Caſes the Perſons are of very different Capacity, who</hi> (as they ought) <hi>do Enquire,</hi> and according to the different Capacity each is in, ſo each ought to Enquire what may be done by himſelf to prevent, leſſen, or remove afflicting Evils, or what may be done to haſten, increaſe, and ſecure hoped or enjoy'd Good; this by ſuch perſons ought to be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and effectually done.</p>
            <p>The Divine Providence doth advance ſome to places of the higheſt Power, and Authority; and entruſteth them with advantages of being <hi>Shields of the Earth, Nurſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers</hi> to his Church,<note place="margin">Pſal. 47.9. Iſa. 49.22. Obad. 21. v.</note> 
               <hi>Saviours upon mount Sion.</hi> They that are Defenders of the Faith, They ſhould Enquire what Tidings for or againſt the Church, that they may know what they are to do in repelling Violence and Injuſtice, or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Welfare and Safety of the Publick. The Enquiry ſuch make, is, and ought to be much more Exact, Conſtant, and Solicitous; theſe ſhould not only receive Intelligence, but ſeek it; maintain ſuch as from abroad are fit to give account what is framing againſt the Publick Good of the Civil State, or againſt the Good of the Church of God: Neither of which will be long in Safety, Peace, or Proſper if thoſe who are Watchmen,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.2.</note> and like Shepherds ſhould neglect to Enquire what ravening Beaſts uſually haunt the adjoyning Woods, or Wilderneſſes. Now becauſe it would be too tedious to mention the ſeveral ranks of Men concerned to Enquire into News of a Publick Nature, as <hi>Counſellors</hi> and <hi>Lawgivers, Judges</hi> and <hi>inferiour Magiſtrates, Martial</hi> and <hi>Fighting-men,</hi> who are to turn the Battle in the Gate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miniſters of the Word,</hi> and Spiritual Guides of the Church, yea and all the Members of the Church, are to Enquire into what God is doing for or againſt his Church, as they have in their preſent Station opportunity to do; as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, who Enquired of them that came from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> what Condition that City and People of God were in.</p>
            <p>They who have any ability and power in their hand to do good, to help the Church of God, or any part of it under diſtreſs; proportionably every one of them are to awaken their Enquiries after the ſtate of the Church, and ſet themſelves with diligence to releive it: And ſince we may, (as 'tis our duty) Praiſe God for his Mercy ſhew'd to the Church, and pray for Mercy when wanted, we ſhould know by Enquiry what is our Duty herein. So then by this we may ſee <hi>'tis the particular Office of ſome to Enquire,</hi> and ought to be the Care of all in their places to know, what the Church needs, and they ought to do for it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:187"/>
            <p>But <hi>none may Enquire like the</hi> Athenians. Into which we muſt Enquire now, and pray the Liberty of making diſcovery of this, by what helps we can meet with, both from <hi>Human and Sacred Teſtimony,</hi> what they were,<note place="margin">Incepit reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſium A.

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Theſe</hi> Athenians <hi>began to be a people about the year of the World</hi> 2496. <hi>about</hi> 1558 <hi>An. before Chriſts Birth;</hi> and when this was written it was the 51ſt. year of Chriſt. It was at that time a City 1609 years old under various changes, and grew up to great Trade for Merchants, and as great Learning, for it was through a long courſe of years the Univerſity of the World. And a place that wandring Wits delighted to viſit. Now among ſuch <hi>Capricio</hi>'s, ſo many <hi>curious,</hi> and <hi>inquiſitive Humors,</hi> ſucceeding one another, and inventing New things, and glorying in the invention; no wonder that their Inquiries were Vain, or Ridiculous, or Miſchievous to others. If ſad threatning News were reported, they enquir'd into it; they betook themſelves to their Antiquity, their Power, Wiſdom, and their Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So did <hi>Niniveh</hi> of old, ſo did a City more Antient than <hi>Nineveh, Nah.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If Tidings affrighted <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium,</hi> the duration of the City, <hi>Roma aeternum duratura,</hi> and ſuch like are enquired after as the ſecurity they truſt in. <hi>Jeruſalem, though better taught yet became ſo brutiſh</hi> as to Enquire after vain and helpleſs Refuges againſt bad News: <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 7.4. or elſe they <hi>contenm the Rod, and him that uſeth it.</hi> Can the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient City, the Glory of the World be deſtroy'd? Or ſhall the Courſe of its Proſperity after many hundred years be changed into Miſery? This were <hi>Athenian</hi> like to enquire into the Effects of New Cauſes. If new Judgments threaten us for our old Sins, and we hear that they approach, a Chriſtian Enquiry ſhould be, How we may prevent the Execution by a ſpeedy return unto God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>The temper the</hi> Athenians <hi>are repreſented to us in, will help us to gheſs what Enquiries they would make upon New Emergencies.</hi> And our own Reaſon will tell us that all ſuch Enquiries unbeſeem a Chriſtian. Let us view the <hi>Athenians</hi> in their temper, as <hi>Plutarch, Varro, Polybius, Ariſtophanes</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> &amp;c. give it us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Very Suſpitious and Jealous.</hi> Now whatever other Abilities a man may have to make right Enquiries of New Occurrences, this one Vice or Diſtemper is enough to diſturb all; Jealouſie will take amiſs all that is Good, and ſuſpect 'tis Evil; it will aggravate evil and make it worſe than it is: No right judgment is made, or if a man of ſuch temper ſtumble upon the right nature, tendency, and importance of unuſual things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, yet he cannot fix, or be conſtant in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> Athenians <hi>were naturally prone to Anger,</hi> ſoon took Fire upon what they heard, or ſaw, and thought to be worthy of their Anger, and this was a perpetual Anger.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> Now Jealouſie like a dark Cloud darkens our thoughts and Judgment; Anger like the Lightning that breaks out of that Cloud, is of more deſtructive Fire, than of directing Light, and too quick and impetuous to allow us time of thinking aright, or Enquiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: if the News then diſpleaſe this Paſſion, the man cannot judge aright
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:40119:187"/> till he hath maſter'd his Anger, and can debate the whole calmly with himſelf. Where this double Rage prevail'd, none could enquire into new Occurrences in right manner, nor be an Example for us to imitate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They were cloſe Diſſemblers, very Deceitful.</hi>

Now what Enquiry will ſuch temper'd Men entertain you with, upon any News they meet with? They Enquire into particulars which may facilitate their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges, that may ſatisfie their malice, and endanger an innocent, which an honeſt plain-hearted reporter never dreamt of. Like <hi>Joab</hi> enquiring the News at Court, How <hi>Abner</hi> was entertain'd, how long ſince, and which way he went, what Company with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Enquiries an honeſt heart would never have miſtruſted came from a bloody Heart, if <hi>Joab</hi>'s bloody hand had not at laſt appear'd.</p>

To ſum up all in brief, ſince we are from good Teſtimony aſſured that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were Suſpicious, Angry, Diſſemblers, boldly Impudent, Lovers of their own Praiſe, and as much Vilifyers of others, Quarrelſom and Contentious, Unruly, Terrible to their Governours, and diſingenious to the height of Malice againſt Strangers ſojourning with them, (tho' ſome were better among them) we may not fetch our Copy from ſuch Perſons, nor Enquire as the moſt of ſuch kind of men would Enquire.

            <p>Hitherto we have conſulted Men in their Reports of the <hi>Athenian</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Let us now ſee what the Text and Context will afford us, for theſe will be a moſt ſure Rule, by which we may know how News-Mongers there did pump one another: Theſe enquir'd,</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>They enquire with Pride and Contempt of the Perſons of whom they enquire,</hi> ſo did theſe Philoſophers, before they throughly conſidered what the Apoſtle preach't, and how he confirmed his Aſſertions; they do cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him as an empty Fellow, who talkt much, nimbly, and ſmoothly, but that was all with them, as if there were no weight in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor any thing of moment in his Doctrines: They deſpiſe him, and give him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. the moſt contemptable name of a Babler.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>With unreaſonable partiality, they confeſs their own Ignorance.</hi> There is a God unknown to them, to whom they had erected an Altar, and offered Sacrifices: Now here comes a Man of a ſober Deportment, of quick and ready Parts, clear Judgment, and a cloſe Diſputer, who offers to inſtruct them, and tell them who this unknown God is, and how he ought to be Worſhipped; but Bruits as they were, they'l rather be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſtill, than learn by the Apoſtle: And though a patient, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hearing of the Apoſtle would have filled <hi>Athens</hi> with greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter News than ever was brought to their Ears; yet they who made it their buſineſs to hear all News, make it their Sin and Folly to refuſe this News.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>With Reſolutions not to be perſwaded, though they were ſilenced,</hi> or <hi>convinced:</hi> This appeareth partly from their contempt of his Perſon, before they heard his Doctrine, and the reaſons of it; partly from their obſtinate adhearing to Idols, and Worſhip of them, though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had by cleareſt reaſon diſcovered the abſurdity thereof in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſcourſe of the Nature of God, and his Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And partly by the effect his Reaſoning had upon <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyte,</hi> who believed, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. Now <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was of the number of thoſe whoſe Fame was great at <hi>Athens</hi> for Wiſdom, Integrity, and Juſtice:
<pb facs="tcp:40119:189"/> For want of theſe Qualities, theſe Philoſophhers reject the Apoſtle, and the new Doctrine which he preached.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Theſe</hi> Athenians <hi>did with Tumult and Violence make their Enquiry</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the new things St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached.

               </note> Or, <hi>laid hands on him, as on a guilty Perſon.</hi> They enquire not as became Learners, or ſober Diſputers. But,</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>They hurry him before the</hi> Areopagites <hi>Court, to anſwer it with his Life, for either denying the</hi> Athenians <hi>Gods, or endeavouring to bring it new Gods without the approbation of the</hi> Areopagites,<note place="margin">Quia ingerit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Daemonia. <hi>Lorin. in loc.</hi>

               <hi>both which were Capital by the Law,</hi> and had endangered many Heads, coſt ſome their Life; as <hi>Socrates</hi> condemned to Death by this Court, in which Two Hundred Eighty and One Votes concurred in the Sentence againſt him.</p>
            <p>All theſe particulars laſt mention'd are evident in this Context from the 17 <hi>ver.</hi> to the 32 <hi>ver.</hi> and I leave it you to judge, whether this way of Enquiry becometh a Chriſtian. Many Chriſtians begin their Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new things with Prejudices, carry them on in Curioſity, Pride and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and cloſe them with obſtinate adhering to old Errors, and refuſing Truth new diſcovered; and in the tumultuouſneſs of a Rabble bring the Publiſhers of Truth and Godlineſs into apparent Danger of their Lives? This the whole progreſs of the <hi>Athenian</hi> diſpute with the Apoſtle, If you remember theſe things, you will know what you ought not to do, and I have hopes you will forbear doing that which you know too evil in a Heathen, and more evil in a Chriſtian, and would be moſt evil in us who have ſeen bloody Effects of News raiſed, abetted, witneſſed, and ſworn by profligate, perjur'd Perſons, not before <hi>Areopagites,</hi> but before Judges; raiſed to take away the Life of Innocents, and to condemn ſuch, whoſe Love, and Care, whoſe Power and Reſolution qualified them to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots to their Country and the Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>The</hi> Athenians <hi>ſpent too much time in telling and hearing News of any ſort, whether important or a triflle, certain or doubtful,</hi> So be, its News, 'tis that pleaſeth them: They ever have leiſure to hear it, nothing cometh more acceptably to them: This Diſeaſe hath deſcended from Age to Age, and been moſt pernicious to the Great, Rich, Voluptuous, and Proud Ports, Cities and Academies of the World: A Diſeaſe the Wiſeſt and moſt Serious have complain'd of, but the vain and fooliſh would not be ſenſible of, or cured. The waſte of time never to be recall'd, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our neceſſary Affairs, loſs in Trades and Employments, ſpreading of falſe Stories of others, provoking diſpleaſure againſt others and our ſelves on ſuch occaſions, endangering our ſelves and others by engaging in Parties and Quarrels, increaſing Diſcontents amongſt thoſe we ſhould endeavour to unite, giving occaſions to Enemies, and falſe Accuſers to lay to our charge things we know not, falling under ſuſpicion of Plotters and Conſpirators againſt the Publick Weal.</p>
            <pb n="404" facs="tcp:40119:189"/>
            <p>All theſe and much more might be Arguments againſt an Immoderate attendance on publick places of News amongſt us, where Wiſe Men come and ſtay whilſt their neceſſary buſineſs calls and requires; and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fools continue till they fall. Peſt of the Nation, and bane of Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, common Nuiſances, and publick Miſchiefs in the Opinion of ſome Wiſe and Good Men: But when the places are blamed, they that come there too often, and ſtay there too long, are in the fault, and ſhould (I think) be puniſht. I could wiſh there were a Redreſs of all the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences and Vices that ſpring up in Coffee-Houſes; but I believe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man who frequents them, muſt mend his own faults herein, and not expect Directions from a Pulpit, how often or ſeldom, how long or ſhort a time, what buſineſs with Friends and Chapmen to wait for, or meet there: Go not thither but on buſineſs thou canſt beſt do there, ſtay but till it is done, and though many complain of the Coffee-Houſes, they cannot condemn thee.</p>
            <p>But I paſs on, to tell you how (in theſe places which ſeem to be <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Redevivae;</hi> and the Company we meet there like <hi>Athenian News-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> all enquiring what is Neweſt) you may as Chriſtians ought, enquire what News of Church-Affairs, that you may the better manage your Prayers for the Church in trouble, or praiſe God for good wrought for it, which is the Second Part, and Poſitive Part of the Caſe before us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Then a Chriſtian ought to make Enquiry into News that concerns the Church, according to the Advantage and Capacity he hath more fully to know both the Good and Welfare of the People of God, or to know the Sorrows and Dangers that lye upon the Church:</hi> Some lye under an Incapacity of knowing much of the Affairs of their own Countrey, and the Church in it, who never heard any thing, ſo much as the Name of ſome of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, nor are they any way likely to know much of them; yet theſe ought to enquire what they can, that their Prayers and Praiſes for the Church may be ſuitable to what they know of the Church. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem muſt not be forgotten, ſhe muſt be pray'd for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such who know few but their Chriſtian Relations, or Neighbours, may know the Sorrows, Dangers, Wants of theſe, and ought to pray for them, as they are Members of the Church, and conſider the like State other Chriſtians are in, and muſt be pray'd for, <hi>&amp;c. We are to mourn with thoſe that mourn, and rejoyce with thoſe that rejoyce:</hi> That we may the better do this, we ſhould enquire the moſt we can into the preſent State of the Church. But more eſpecially,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſtian Kings, Princes, and Supreme Magiſtrates, as Nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Defenders, and Promoters of Chriſt's Kingdom and People, ought to Enquire, and maintain Intelligences;</hi> whereby they may underſtand what is the State of all the Churches of God, with which they and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects hold a Commerce, that ſo either Publick Prayers or Praiſes may be made for the Church. <hi>Moſes</hi> hath given us Example of this kind, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.23, 24. who did deliberately conclude with himſelf, that he would vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit his Brethren, the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and with his own Eyes ſurvey their Condition, that he might ſuitably addreſs himſelf to help them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb facs="tcp:40119:190"/> they would know God would deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Some few we meet in Hiſtory, who have concern'd themſelves for the Church of Chriſt abroad, without their own Dominions now and then. A <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> appears to defend the Church, and to mind a <hi>Licinius</hi> to forbear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Church: Or, an <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to ſupport a Neighbour-Church: Or, a <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus to reſcue oppreſſed Churches:</hi> Or, ſuch as we have in our day ſeen raiſed to be a Father and a Mother to his People in this Kingdom: It was well for us that God awakened them to Enquire what State the Church was in here, and how it might be reſcu'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Nobles and Counſellors about Chriſtian Princes and Kings,</hi> who have opportunity to know publick Concerns of Churches abroad above other Men, <hi>ought to Enquire more particularly and fully,</hi> That they may the better adviſe Inferiour ones to pray for the Church, or praiſe God as the Seaſons require; and that they may imploy their Intereſt at home with their own King, or abroad in Foreign Courts for the good of the Church: Which way ſoever <hi>Mordecai</hi> firſt ſcented <hi>Haman</hi>'s Plot, He acquitted himſelf in this point, gave not over the Enquiry, till he had done his beſt to reſcue the <hi>Jews.</hi> Much of the ſame temper was <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who at Court in fullneſs of Honour, Riches, and Eaſe, could not forget <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 1.2, 3.</note> nor let ſlip an opportunity of acquainting himſelf with the Condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> there, and addreſſeth himſelf to rebuild and repair it. Had not King <hi>James</hi> I. <hi>and his Nobles</hi> about him enquir'd into the Plot, the Church and Kingdom had been ruin'd, though the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> diſcover'd what he knew of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Embaſſadors in the Courts of Princes that are Enemies to the Truth and Church,</hi> and ready to extirpate both, <hi>have advantage of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> what Dangers threaten the Churches under ſuch Princes Dominions, and in ſuch caſe, <hi>they are fitteſt to acquaint the Prince</hi> who ſent them that loves the Church, and is foſter Father to it; that by his Mediation, and Intereſt, the Deſign of Enemy-Princes, and Perſecutors may be ſtopt; and endangered Subjects and Chriſtians may be ſecured. The <hi>French</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant had been at his Dragooning Converſions ſome years ſooner (as I have heard) if on the News of his Deſign (communicated by Embaſſadour to his Maſter, a Neighbouring Conquerour,) expreſs Orders had not been ſent to the Embaſſadour to require preſent and peremptory Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to recall the Marching Troops. So much the ſafety of the Church may ſometimes depend upon the Vigilance and Zeal of ſuch Publick Miniſters of State: Wiſe Embaſſadors of our Neighbours I doubt not informed their Maſters and our Friends what dangerous Plots were laid againſt us and them, and all the Churches of Chriſt: So that now <hi>the Snare is brok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urthly, Chief Commanders in Martial Affairs who are Chriſtians, are concern'd to enquire what State the Church is in among thoſe on whom they are commanded to make War;</hi> ſometimes Multitude of Chriſtians may be within the Quarters, under the Power of the Enemy; ſometimes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:40119:190"/> of an eminent Character, and highly valu'd by all that know the Truth, and love it, may be threatned to be deſtroy'd by the Enemy: In ſuch caſe a plain, brave, and peremptory Meſſage, that the Enemies Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhall be retaliated, may ſave many Lives: So many Chriſtians have been preſerved from Turkiſh Fury, many Proteſtants from Popiſh Rage, both in days paſt and of late. So <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s caſe was weigh'd by the Chief Captain of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Merchants, who travel into far remote parts</hi> for their Trade, <hi>and Gentlemen who travel for their pleaſure,</hi> and to ſatisfie themſelves by an occular ſurvey of Countreys, and Cities (of which they often heard Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſcarce to be believed on hear-ſay:) Theſe have ſome greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to ſee and hear the low and ſinking State, or the riſing and flouriſhing Condition of thoſe Churches which are planted in ſuch Countreys; and as Chriſtians they are bound to obſerve, inform themſelves, and tell others how 'tis with the Churches that Prayers and Praiſes may be offer'd unto God for them: But this is very little minded by Merchants when abroad, and leſs minded by them, when return'd home with Wealth (greater than ever they hoped.) Though Religion decay, and Churches leſſen in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Knowledge, Faith and Holineſs; yet who of them out of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance ſettle a tribute of Thankfulneſs to God, making Proviſion for the ſending and maintaining Preachers and School-maſters among them? Wo'd the enriched Merchants remember their Duty to God, and what Thanks they owe to the People who were kind to them in Travels and Trading, there would be ſome ſettlements made to encourage ſuch as are fit and willing to employ themſelves in promoting the Welfare of the Churches, but Poverty and Low Condition in the World forbids them to do it on their own Eſtate, and no due proviſion is made by others to ſupport them in ſuch a work. Some few of this travelling diſpoſition (though poor) do go abroad Tutors to ſome young raw Gentlemen, who being ſo unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, and imprudent among Strangers, and ever endangering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if the Tutor be abſent; he can do little but attend them in every place, and ſpend his time in viewing things that pleaſe young fancies, and profit none but thoſe that are Door-keepers, or Officers about the places: One ſhort Tour of a Learned Man (now a great Prelate among us) gives us aſſurance that Travels might give us good Intelligence of the State of the Church, were there due care taken in this,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarem</hi>
               </note> by Perſons who could bear the Expences of Prudent, Experienced, and Diligent Perſons, Lovers of the Truth and Church, as well as Lovers of Knowledge, we might in a ſhort time have a good account of the true ſtate of all, or moſt of the Churches of Chriſt, and our Praiſes would be more ſeaſonable and ſuitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, There are the whole Tribe of</hi> Levi, Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, who live upon the Emoluments of the Church; <hi>Theſe above others ſhould concern themſelves for the Church.</hi> Theſe are to manage Publick Prayers and Praiſes for the Church; theſe are to be Examples to others, to kindle the Affections of their people to pray and praiſe as occaſions require. They are or ſhould be able to take account of the Church-Affairs written and publiſht to the World in ſeveral Languages: They ſhould be diligent
<pb facs="tcp:40119:191"/> Readers of ſuch Books: They more than others ſhould underſtand the Times and Seaſons of the Prophecies; and how the Wilderneſs State ends, or the State of Return out of the Wilderneſs begins; eſpecially, under ſuch Revolutions as we now are, as whither the Witneſſes are riſing, or whether any Vials, or how many are poured forth; whether we are to encourage the People of God to hope for a ſpeedy Deliverance, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them to expect and prepare for ſorer and longer Troubles: Theſe and ſuch like Enquiries the Learned Clergy are much more fit to make then the Layety, and I think they are bound to it more than others: But in a more particular manner, thoſe of the Clergy who have preferments which will bear the Charges of,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All ſorts of Books that concern this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All ſorts of Ammanuenſes and Helps to read and give account to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All ſorts of Intelligencies and Correſpondencies with Biſhops and Paſtors of the Churches abroad.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Entertaining and Converſing with all Exiles, Refugees, and Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that come from Forreign Churches.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sending (if need be) particular Meſſengers to know the Truth or falſhood of what is reported to them. Rich Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Deans might and ought to do thus or more for the Church of Chriſt. I do not know how much of this Work is ſet on foot, or whether none. I can hardly think among ſo many and Learned Men, as have Great and Rich Preferments in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis wholly omitted: They do, I believe, receive Intelligences from abroad; and if theſe be as true as thoſe that ſome of them have ſent abroad concerning the State of God's Church here in <hi>England,</hi> no wonder they <hi>all grow worſe and worſe, deceiving, and being deceived,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid of ſome other Men, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. In giving all Intelligences to others, let us keep; and in receiving all from them, let us deſire them to keep to the Apoſtles Direction: Inform <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>ſpeaking the Truth in Love.</hi> It is an inexcuſable Crime to be malicious Slanderers one of another: And ſince the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in points of Faith and good Manners, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of Popery as fully as is required, are both ſubſcribed, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the Government aſſured by Oath or Subſcription, let none ſuch be any more miſrepreſented as of no Principles in Religion, Friends to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and Enemies to Monarchy and Government. Ingenuity and Truth is much wanting both in Words and Writings of Men, that ſhould deſcribe their Brethren to Foreigners; inſtead of which, they decipher a Monſter of their own making, and ſet it up to be abhorred by all that ſee or hear it. A Famous Profeſſor of Divinity in a Univerſity and City (with which the whole Diſſenting Party are often upbraided) knew not our State or Cauſe for many years; who when he was informed aright, wondred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly at our ill uſage at home, and worſe repreſentation abroad. I am I confeſs tempted to ſuſpect very great partiality and falſhood in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtorians, both Antient and Modern; who have wrote with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, Enmity, and Partiality of ſworn Vaſſals to a Party.</p>
            <pb n="406" facs="tcp:40119:191"/>
            <p>Were there a Colledge of judicious, impartial, diligent, and able Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians imploy'd and encouraged to ſearch out the truth of all miſ-reported parties and tell the world their beſt, as well as their worſt hath been told by others, it would (I think) be an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory far more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable than any I yet have ſeen. <hi>Quis dabit Thuanum Eccleſiaſticum!</hi> After ſo long a Diſcourſe on the firſt Direction, Enquire as fully as your capacity and opportunity can enable you.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If you would Enquire as Chriſtians ought, to affect your hearts in order to pray or praiſe God for the Church, <hi>Let your Thoughts be much upon the Importance of what is reported to you.</hi> Weigh well what influence the New things are likely to have on the good or evil, to the comfort or the diſcomfort of the Church-Catholick, or any particular Churches near to or far from you. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> no doubt weigh'd the importance of the News brought to him from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and it was thought reaſonable that <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> on the firſt appearance of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what Importance it was to ſee ſuch a Man as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, how likely he might be to bring them out. When the Edict for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s return out of Captivity was firſt ſpread as good News to the <hi>Jews,</hi> none of them reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it aright who conſidered only his perſonal advantage by it. They pray'd and prais'd God aright who look't into the Import of it to the whole Church.</p>
            <p>The News of the death of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and Succeſſion of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is not enquired after till the certainty of the Reformation of Religion, and the great change for the better in the Church is lookt into.</p>

               <hi>Julian</hi>'s death was great and good newes to the Church, and called for praiſe to God; but thoſe that conſidered not the influence it would have upon the Church for good if God rais'd up a Chriſtian Succeſſor, muſt needs fall very far ſhort in their prayer and praiſe. When the News of the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth afflicted the hearts of Gods children in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and they mourn'd and pray'd as apprehenſive of the conſequences of the death of a pious Prince, a Zealous Reformer, a Hearty Lover of Truth and profeſſor of it; whileſt he lay ſick theſe conſiderations quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd them of that Age to beg his life. So when the ſickneſs of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was the News on the Stage, and her death would be the ſafety of the Church; no wiſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> enquired after the News without a thought how much it would benefit the Church to loſe her.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Who Enquires</hi> as a Chriſtian in order to manage Prayer and Praiſe, <hi>ſhould I think Enquire of thoſe who can, and will inform him the beſt, moſt truly and ſincerely of any News he knoweth.</hi> There ever have been, and now are perſons who abuſe the world with falſe Reports: to amuſe the more ſimple-hearted, they dare coin Lies, and cry out Wo! Wo! or Peace! Peace! very unagreeably to the nature and aſpect of Affairs. If you have a Friend who dares not wittingly ſpread a Lye, nor deny a Truth, and knows much of publick Occurrences; thou mayeſt rely ſomewhat on his word, thou mayeſt with greater confidence pray for the Church in
<pb facs="tcp:40119:192"/> deep Diſtreſs, and Praiſe God for bringing it out of its Diſtreſs. When we know the Church needs our Prayers, it is moſt agreeable to God that we do pray. If when we praiſe God for the Church, in any particular, if afterwards it appear we were deceived by falſe Reports the Enemy ſcoffs at us, we ſhould to the beſt of our knowledge pray and praiſe ſuitably to the real ſtate of the Church. It was a common practice in our late Civil Wars upon a fight that both Parties kept Thankſgiving Days, when 'twas not poſſible both ſhould have the Victory; this was highly Scandalous, and each upbraided others with Hypocriſie Let us as much as in us lieth prevent ſuch a reproof; what we cannot be Eye-witneſs of but muſt take on Hear-ſay, let us endeavour to be truly informed, that both prayer and praiſes may be grounded on the Truth of things as they proceed from Truth of Heart. Tragical Stories of Catholicks proſecuted in <hi>England</hi> when <hi>Garnet</hi> and ſome few others were executed for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Helliſh <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> ſet many a deceived <hi>Papiſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Tears and Prayers, who had they known the Truth of things would have prais'd God for preſerving their King and Countrey, condemned the Traitors and own'd the Hand of God in the Diſcovery of the Plot and puniſhment of Plotters. On the other ſide, when bloody Men imbru'd their Hands in blood of many Thouſand Innocents in the <hi>Pariſian Maſſacre,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, deſtroy'd Innocent <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by Hundreds of Thouſands, it is palliated with falſe Rumors to leſſen the Horrour of the Fact, the Barbarous Cruelty of the Actors; as if a few turbulent perſons had been prevented, and fallen by the hands of Self-Defenders. Which had it been a Truth, who could have found in their hearts to pray for ſuch? But with reſpect to all ſuch bloody uſage of the Innocent Church in all Ages paſt, and in this of ours we will pray with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Let God be known by the avenging the blood of his Saints, Pſal.</hi> 70.10.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Who Enquires as a Chriſtian, muſt Enquire with a Compaſſionate Affection to the ſuffering Churches of Chriſt;</hi> or feeling their Wounds as living Members feel the griefs and wounds of the Body in what part ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, preparing to help the whole and bear his own part; as one who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above his chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oy, and can heartily rejoyce in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; as one whoſe heart is wounded with the ſame ſword that wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore bitterly bemoaneth, and heartily prayeth for the bleeding Church. Give us an <hi>Nehemiah, who chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>ſate down, and wept when he heard ſad tydings, great diſtreſs, and long deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Jeruſalem.</hi> When you Enquire with <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s wiſh, <hi>Oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, Jer.</hi> 9.1. <hi>To weep for the ſlain of the daughter of my people.</hi> Such an heart doth as naturally pour out it ſelf in prayers, as it doth into tears, and doth as naturally rejoyce with the rejoycing Church, as it either wept or pray'd before. When Chriſt foreſaw and foretold the doleful ſtate that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould fall into, he wept over her, and ſo muſt every Chriſtian weep over deſolate and diſconſolate <hi>Jeruſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lem</hi> when he hears her Sorrows, and prays for her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Among Natural Relations few there are who are not affected with
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40119:192"/> grief for the Sorrows, and troubles of a Brother, there ſhould not be one among Spiritual Relations, but ſhould with hearty grief entertain the News of Sorrows and diſtreſs upon the Church, and give God no reſt till he make her a quiet Habitation, till he turn her Mourning into Joy, till he take away the garments of her Widowhood, and cloth her with the garments of his Salvation. When we hear the ſad Tydings with ſuch a Heart as <hi>Joſiah</hi> heard the Threats of the Law read in his preſence; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27. <hi>ver.</hi> then we are like to do as he did to ſeek the Lord, to return to him and make a Covenant with him to ſerve him that he may turn away his diſpleaſure and ſpare his people, <hi>Joſiah heard the news, with a tender heart,</hi> a melting heart, and ſent to Enquire of the Lord, that he might know what was to be done by him and his People, to prevent, or defer, or leſſen, the threatned Evil.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>When you Enquire into the preſent News that concerns the Church,</hi> that you may the better pray for the Church, or praiſe God on behalf of the Church, <hi>Enquire into the ſins of the Church with an humble, mourning, and repenting Heart:</hi> So did <hi>Joſiah</hi> in reading the Law, and comparing <hi>Judah</hi>'s former behaviour, how that people had ſin'd againſt the Law of God, and by this he diſcovered what Sins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Brought them into the danger of Captivity and utter Deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Which were likely to increaſe their danger or continue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Were likely to leſſen the deliverance expected and pray'd for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Which God hath long born with, and at laſt pardon'd that he might deliver a ſinful and unworthy people, though his own.</hi> This will in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability bring the Enquirers on their knees, to confeſs their own and their fathers Sins; to be throughly apprehenſive what need of earneſt prayers that the Lord would purge, pardon, deliver, and fully ſave his Churches. This will make them admire the Lords long-ſuffering, juſtifie his Righteous Judgments, and give him praiſe due to him for leaving us a remnant that at laſt ſhall ſee his full Salvation.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Would you as Chriſtians Enquire into the News of the preſent times, the better to manage prayer and praiſes for the Church? <hi>Enquire then what are the effects of either Good and Welcome, or of Sad and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful News upon ſuch as are nearest concern'd in both.</hi> Do Judgments awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and frighten Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> from their Sins? Do the puniſhments of their Sins work them to deep Humiliation, to publick Repenting and Reforming? Do they return to the Lord that ſmiteth them? Or are they as ſinful, ſecure, and as fearleſs as ever? What effect have Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon his Churches; Do his Mercies prevail with them not to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the preſent evill world but to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. Doth proſperity make them now (as it did between 47.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1, 2.</note> and 60, make profeſſors) worldly proud quarrelſom, unjuſt, perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, irreconcileably divided one from another, enraged one againſt another with that mad, unreaſonable fury as to venture the ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole Church to ſatisfie the revenges of a Party? When I think
<pb facs="tcp:40119:193"/> on theſe and ſuch like ſad miſcarriages I can ſee little cauſe given by the Church to Rejoyce, but much to Mourn. Here's need of prayer, little matter of Thankſgiving in the deportment of the Church. Indeed we ever ought to praiſe the Lord for his Mercies to his people, but we ſtill want that proper ſubject of praiſe to God which a Reformed, United, Holy, and Heavenly Church would be to us. When unexpected and ſtupendious revolutions make the generality of Chriſtians to leave their ſins and return to God, and live more ſuitable to their Heavenly Calling, and love one another as Chriſt commandeth: Then we have abundant cauſe to bleſs and praiſe our God and continue our prayers for a people near to a full Salvation.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Would you as Chriſtians better manage your Prayers and Praiſes for the Church on any New Occurrences? Then Enquire what is the Temper and Deportment of the Churches Enemies.</hi> Are the Enemies of the Church,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Atheiſtical and Blasphemous,</hi> as he was who ſpakes as contemptuouſly of the Lord of Hoſts, as of the Idols of the Nations whom his Father had deſtroy'd Are they grown up to <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s height of Atheiſm and Blaſphemy? Do then as <hi>Hezekiah, Iſaiah,</hi> and the people of <hi>Judah</hi> did. It is probable the Enemy is near his fall, you near to the Anſwer of your Prayers, and the Church near to the days of Thankſgiving and praiſe to God. Read the Story in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.1. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 36. and 37. <hi>chap. Atheiſm and Blasphemy</hi> are the Temper and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which we expect ſhall be deſtroy'd; <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1, 5. <hi>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Combined and Confederate against the Church?</hi> So was <hi>Moab, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek, Pſal.</hi> 83.6. <hi>to cut off the name of</hi> Iſrael: So did <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, Ezek.</hi> 38. if that refer to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther already paſt. <hi>So will the Gog and Magog mention'd in the Rev.</hi> 20. So hath the Antichriſtian <hi>Papal</hi> Kingdom done againſt the Church and its probable ſuch a confederacy may be again made againſt the Church, of God. Now when rooting out of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is the end of the confederacy, the Church is furniſht with many prevailing Arguments to uſe in prayer for the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Confident and proud, promiſing themſelves an aſſured Succeſs,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their preparations and reſolutions. So <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> as <hi>I have done, ſo I will do &amp;c. and Gog and Magog, I will go to the unwalled Villages, and I will take the spoil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.11, 12.</p>
            <p>So will the pride and confidence of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Enemy of the Church; <hi>Babylon,</hi> that will ſay, <hi>I ſit a queen, I ſhall not be a widow,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. How ſeaſonably may the Church plead with the Lord to execute his juſt Threats upon her, and bring her Sorrows on her in a moment?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Cruel and mercileſs, ſo was Babylon of old, ſo is Babylon at this day;</hi> this miniſtred occaſion to the captive <hi>Jew</hi> to pray, and move the God of Mercy to remember their low and ſad condition, and reſcue them from thoſe cruel hands which delight in Blood. In the temper of thoſe who have for many Ages waſted the Church of Chriſt, and in theſe laſt three
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40119:193"/> or four years have labour'd to deſtroy it in <hi>France,</hi> moſt unparallel'd cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty hath been practiſed upon the members of Chriſt. <hi>How long holy and true? Rev.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And laſtly, <hi>Would you as Chriſtians Enquire,</hi> in order to the better management of your prayers and praiſes? then whatever News of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you hear concerning the State of the Churches of Chriſt, <hi>be ſure to your beſt knowledge compare thoſe News with theſe things that are ſigns of approaching deliverance, and fuller Salvation from its own ſins and ſelf-created troubles, and from the furious rage of Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Compare the ſtate of the Church and your News of it, with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providences over the Church in the like Circumſtances in times paſt.</hi> Find out ſome inſtance parallel to your preſent caſe in the Scriptures, and in prayer plead it with God for the like, nay for greater help. The various caſes of the Church recorded in Scripture, are glaſſes in which we may ſee what troubles we muſt expect; and Gods Providences to his people are exemplaries for us to conform our Hope and Confidence unto. We may read his Deliverances, and in like caſes ſay, This God is our God, as theirs; he will lead us, preſerve, and deliver us, as them: Hence it is you do ſo often find the people of God concluding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Relief, becauſe he did in like caſe hear prayer, and give his people matter of praiſe in times paſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Compare the News you hear with the expectations of the Generality of the obſervant, praying, meditating, Scripture-wiſe Chriſtians.</hi> Conſider well what the body of theſe look for, whether good or evil. A ſingle Man, or a few of them, may eaſily miſtake in their Conjecture; but it is ſeldom that the whole body of them miſ-time their Expectation. Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was expected by the beſt and wiſeſt, by thoſe who knew the promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> much about the time that God ſent <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore 'tis obſerved of <hi>Moſes</hi> that when he vindicated the injur'd <hi>Hebrew</hi> and ſlew the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> that he ſuppoſed they would have known him to be the perſon God had ſent to deliver them. Near the time of the return from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, many of the Jews expected their Deliverance; ſome that were very Aged could reckon the number of years by their own Age. And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſearched into the nearneſs of it by Books, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2. and we may now hope ſome great (perhaps the laſt and full) deliverance from Antichriſtianiſm is near at hand, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Gods people do expect, as well as pray for it. Pray ye as they do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Compare your great News abroad,</hi> when Kingdoms and States are ſhaken, <hi>with the Threats that are denounced againſt the Enemies of the Church.</hi> Conſult the Word of God in this thing You may diſcover much of the Approaches of Mercy in deliverance of the Church by the Executions of Threats againſt the Enemy. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Execute Judgments upon <hi>Egypt, Iſrael</hi> might well conclude their deliverance was near at hand, when the Rivers were turn'd into blood, <hi>Iſrael</hi> might hope their God was coming to avenge their blood. The
<pb facs="tcp:40119:194"/> 
               <hi>Jews</hi> had good ground to conclude, when the <hi>Medes and Perſians</hi> began the War againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> that their Captivity drew on to an end; and when they read the Mans name who was the great Commander in that Expedition, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by name foretold the Deliverer of Gods Captives, and builder of the Temple, if then they did not pray earneſtly, and praiſe God heartily, they were inexcuſably ſtupid, and wanting to their own Releaſe. It will much help you in prayer at this day if you will look into the ſeveral Menaces pronounced in the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and obſerve which of them are in part Executed, which are now Executing; which of the Trumpets we are under, and which of the three woes are now Executing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this we might conclude the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seventh Trumpet near, and the Kingdoms of the VVorld e're long are like to be the Kingdoms of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Look to Promiſes made to the Church for her Deliverance, when you hear of, or Enquire after any great News among the States and Kingdoms of the World, among which the Churches of Chriſt ſojourn, and among which the Saints of God have and ſtill do ſuffer.</hi> It needs not a particular proof that there are many expreſs Promiſes that the Church ſhall be delivered, that there is a fixed time for the beginning, progreſs and full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Promiſes, that their accompliſhments ſhall be gradual, and ſuch as will clear it ſelf, and though we cannot ſay when the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment to a Day or Month or Year, yet by comparing Tranſactions and Occurrences with Promiſes, we may without doubt diſcover ſomewhat of the Promiſe made good to the Church for which we ought to praiſe the Lord, and all the reſt of the Promiſes ſhall be fulfilled, and for this we ſhould earneſtly pray to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Compare the great News in the preſent Revolutions, with the Times God hath been pleaſed to make known to us in his Word.</hi> By this you may diſcern what Encouragement, and awakening Conſiderations are given to us to pray and praiſe our God for what is already done, and for what is doing, and what e're long is to be finiſhed. Here is work for learned Men, for Miniſters, for Underſtanding Saints. There are in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations two diſtinct Numbers mention'd, which were they clearly unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would enable us as very wiſe Chriſtians to receive, ſeek, and improve the great News that is abroad in the World.</p>
            <p>The firſt Period is that <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15. <hi>They, i. e.</hi> the four Angels bound at <hi>Euphrates, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh power were prepar'd for an Hour, and a Day, and a Month, and a Year; i. e.</hi> for Three Hundred Ninety Six Years, and a very little more. Now from One Thouſand Three Hundred, in which <hi>Oſman</hi> or <hi>Ottoman</hi> was Elected King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> they have been the deſtruction of the Chriſtians, and were to be until Three Hundred Ninety Six Years were expired, <hi>i. e.</hi> till One Thouſand Six Hundred Ninety Six, which will in likelihood end their Empire, and how great Hope of this now? This calls us to pray for their Ruin.</p>
            <p>The ſecond great Period is of the Forty Two Months, <hi>i. e.</hi> One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Two Hundred and Sixty Years; the time the Beaſt was to perſecute the Church, and then the Beaſt was to periſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Papal Kingdom
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40119:194"/> ſhall be deſtroy'd. Now theſe One Thouſand Two Hundred and Sixty Years in likelihood began about Four Hundred Seventy Five or ſomewhat ſooner, and by this Account you may ſuppoſe the News you ſtill hear of both <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Papacy,</hi> will encourage you to hope for a ſpeedy deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Church from both.</p>
            <p>It will be worth your while to read thoſe Excellent peices of Mr. <hi>Joſeph Mede,</hi> who wrote his Key of the Revelation above Threeſcore Years ago in <hi>Latin,</hi> I cannot ſay whether it be Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> having alwayes kept my ſelf to the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy; but 'tis a Thouſand pitties it ſhould be confin'd to <hi>Latin;</hi> a Book fit to be publiſht in all Languages.</p>
            <p>Of Mr. <hi>Jurien, Accompliſhment of Propheſies,</hi> Tranſlated out of <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of a Nameleſs Author newly written in <hi>French,</hi> and tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Printed lately under the Title of <hi>A New Syſtem of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I commend to you who would know the Importance of publick News, How to pray and praiſe God; on hearing it, How to wait for Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, to read diligently thoſe Books in which are greater and better News than any Pacquets, then all Gazzetts or Coffee-houſes can yet afford to you, when you have read theſe Books then Long for One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Six Hundred Ninety Six, or One Thouſand Seven Hundred; and hope if you live to that day to hear <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire deſtroy'd with that Empire. Wiſh for One Thouſand Seven Hundred Thirty Five, or One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Forty; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I do not pretend to Propheſie, but I do diſmiſs with a conjecture that between this time and that you'l ſee great Deliverances to the Churches of Chriſt, and as great Diſtreſſes and Judgments executed on the Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kingdom, it may be the total Ruin of that Kingdom which was to laſt but One Thouſand Two Hundred and Sixty Years, and I think will have out-laſted that Period before One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Forty.</p>

               <hi>OMnipotence</hi> can ſuffer no Difficulty, and that which is <hi>Immenſe,</hi> can admit no Limits.

            <p>This Sermon forepraiſed, conſiſts of Two Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A <hi>Dehortation</hi> from ſinful Paſſions and Pleaſures: Which is edged with a moſt emphatick <hi>Irony,</hi> or Deriſion Preſſed with a Threat of God's damnatorie <hi>Judgment.</hi> And ſhut up with a cooling conſideration of both the feathery Lightneſs, and the winged Tranſitorineſs of Youthful Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.9, 10.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) An <hi>Exhortation</hi> unto the Choice and Proſecution of ſaving Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This is in my Text: Wherein it is guarded with an admirable <hi>Prolep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> preventive of all ſhifts and procraſtinations. And in the next Words and Verſes, is reinforced with numerous Arguments: Arguments, as many as <hi>Old Age</hi> hath Maladies, and as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprepared Death</hi> hath Terrors. And theſe all cloathed with Language, hardly to be matched in all the Sacred Writings. But I muſt confine me to my Text, Wherein are obvious,

            <p>
               <hi>The Duty</hi> is Converſion unto God. <hi>Inchoative</hi> and <hi>Progreſſive</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Entrance into, Continuance and Progreſs in, the State of Holineſs. The State of Reconciliation unto, and Communion with God. With God the Father, Son, and Spirit; all <hi>joyntly</hi> as One God; and each <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly</hi> as Three Perſons. Learned Men do judge this latter to be here deſigned, by the Plural Number of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word. All Interpreters acknowledge, that the required Remembrance imports no leſs than the foreſaid Converſion: And it will be evident, if theſe things be conſider'd <hi>Words of Knowledge, Affection, and Practice, do ever connote one the other.</hi> Becauſe the Faculties of our Souls, be like the Links of a Chain; ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they go all together: Draw one, all come. Wherefore when the Holy Ghoſt ſummons all, he uſeth to name but one of them. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:40119:196"/> commands us to Know, Remember, Love, or Serve God, but he commands us to do them all. Now to do all theſe, is to Convert unto God: And to do leſs, is not to Remember our Creator as he doth require. Beſides, <hi>The Connexion of End and Means is indiſpenſable.</hi> Where any Means are required, it is certain the End of theſe Means is alſo required. And it is very plain that the meer <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Remembrance of God, is but a Mean; Converſion foreſaid, is the end of it: That End, without which, the Remembrance of God, could only make us the more like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Devil: Who indeed doth never <hi>Forget,</hi> but doth ſtill <hi>Hate</hi> his Creator. And no mind can bear the thought of Gods requiring ſuch a Remembrance. It muſt therefore be one, efficacious unto its End, that is here meant: Nor is it unworthy of our Notice, That <hi>the word [Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor] here is big with Argument:</hi> And ſuch as carries Obligation unto the very utmoſt of the foreſaid Converſion: For it ſpeaks God's <hi>Intereſt</hi> in us. Were we made by him? Then were we alſo made for him, and are his; and not our own. It expreſſeth alſo his <hi>ſpeciality of Intereſt in us;</hi> being (as we are elſewhere told,) he made us in his own Image: If ſo, he made us unqueſtionably for his eſpecial Service. It no leſs ſetteth forth his <hi>Preſervation</hi> of us too; for who but he who made us, ſhould have Power or Will to maintain us? Briefly, it manifeſts his <hi>Power to deſtroy us;</hi> and his very good <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſo to do, if we do leſs, after our Apoſtacy and his Proviſion for our Recovery, than thus Convert unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parties</hi> here Commanded to Convert, are the ſame as are nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9. Poſſeſſors of Childhood and Youth.

               <hi>By Childhood and Youth the Holy Ghoſt intends the whole flouriſhing Age of Life.</hi> The ſame <hi>Hebrew</hi> word ſignifying Youth and Choice, we take them all to be comprehended, who are yet in the beſt and moſt deſirable forepart of their dayes. All, from them, whoſe Morning doth but yet dawn, to thoſe whoſe Clock hath ſtruck Twelve, and with whom its Noon.

The Original words of Age, are of ſo large ſignification. And, as, on the other hand, all the Periods of breaking, declining Old Age muſt be judged to come under the name of <hi>Evil Dayes:</hi> No reaſon appears, why all the periods of the contrary Age ſhould not be put under the name of <hi>Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> or <hi>Choice Dayes.</hi> All young Gameſters are here called to God. <hi>Children,</hi> from their playing for Pins: <hi>Boys</hi> from their playing for Pence. <hi>Young Men</hi> from their playing for Mony and Land: All from their <hi>ſeveral Games of equal folly.</hi> The Games, in which invaluable <hi>Souls</hi> be loſt; and the beſt that is got, is but Yellow <hi>Duſt.</hi> Theſe Spritful, Sportive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>
               <hi>The Time,</hi> wherein theſe Tribes are, all of them, commanded to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, is the preſent. <hi>Remember</hi> hath its <hi>Now</hi> expreſly added. Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, both your Delay until the Afternoon of your Life-day; and your Delay unto any other Day, Hour, or Minute of your Forenoon: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that God's Tribute be paid as the Kings Tax is, upon ſight: And that not the leaſt diſtance of time be admitted, between your diſcerning, and your doing your Duty.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine thus offers now it ſelf:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſent Converſion, is the Duty of Youths and Children; even the very Youngeſt that are come to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Or thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not for Young Men and Maidens, for School-Boyes and Girls, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Children in Hanging-ſleeves, to put off their Converſion to God ſo much as a Minute of an Hour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall competently demonſtrate, if I make good theſe two Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That theſe Young Folk are really bound to Convert preſently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they are ſingularly engaged and encouraged by God ſo to do; and are advantaged more for it than Older People are; and than they themſelves can be when they are Older.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I eſſay by theſe following very <hi>Intelligible</hi> and <hi>Invincible</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Hear them as for your Lives, O you Young ones, to whom I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them? If you hear aright, you live; and Joy will be in Heaven by and by for your new Birth. If not, we deſpiſed Preachers ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear you accurſing your <hi>cloſed</hi> Ears: Exclaiming much like unto <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our Miniſters; in that we ſaw the anguiſh of their Souls, when they beſought us to convert preſently, and we would not hear; therefore is diſtreſs,</hi> (and it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs Damnation) <hi>come upon us.</hi> However in Duty unto all, and in hope of gaining ſome, in God's fear I tell you:</p>
            <p>R. 1 <hi>You are Commanded as truly as the Oldeſt People Living, to turn unto God preſently:</hi> Therefore 'tis your Duty. The King of <hi>Babylon</hi> would have Young Men ſtand before him: So would the King of Heaven. He calls you, the Youngeſt of you: And as expreſly, and frequently, and more frequently, than he calls Old People: For he calls you conjunctly with them, in moſt, or all Texts in the Bible; and he calls you apart here, and in other Portions of Scripture by your ſelves: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye:</hi> 'Tis not <hi>turn ye,</hi> O ye Old decrepit Folk: But <hi>Turn ye</hi> Indefinitely, that is, Univerſally, O ye of all Ages that hear the Word. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.12, 13. <hi>Young Men and Maidens,</hi> and (as <hi>Old Men,) Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are called to Praiſe the Lord. [Nagnarim]</hi> little Children; the word indeed is put for <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 41.12. and <hi>Gideons</hi> Son, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.20. But (as the Etymology carryes it) 'tis moſt frequently uſed, to ſignifie New-born Children, juſt ſhaken out of the Womb: And is very often put to ſignifie Children, juſt able to ſpeak, and run up and down, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:197"/>
            <p>You the Children of Believing Parents, have an Holineſs of <hi>Covenant-Relation</hi> before you are born, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. You have an Holineſs of <hi>Solemn Dedication</hi> by and by after you are born, in Holy Baptiſm; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. And, God requires your Parents and Miniſters to be dealing with you as ſoon as you come to Underſtanding, for Holineſs of <hi>Inheſion and Qualification.</hi> He ſaith there is a way of Holineſs, in which every <hi>(Nagnar)</hi> little Child ſhould go, and commands us to Catechiſe and Train you up in it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. Nor doth he allow you to delay the little that you can do for your Souls, any more than he allows the Oldeſt People to delay any thing, that is in their Power to do. <hi>Now, now,</hi> is his Word unto all Sinners, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. And <hi>Now, now,</hi> is his Word unto you. <hi>His Command for Duty, and for Haſt of Duty, equally binds Children of tender Years, and people of Fourſcore.</hi> Remember it Young People; if you be not commanded to come unto God, and to abide with him, there is no Sinner in the <hi>World</hi> commanded to <hi>Convert,</hi> nor any Saint in the <hi>Church</hi> commanded to <hi>Perſevere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Need I tell you what an Authority his is, who doth ſo command? And how infinitely obliging? 'Tis ſuch an one as cannot be told you by Man or Angel. Should God command you to cut off your Right hands, or to run into the Fire, it would be infinitely your <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to do it For ſo <hi>Supream and Abſolute</hi> is his Authority, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Command beyond <hi>his Right.</hi> And 'tis an <hi>Authority ſo conſtantly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Infinite Goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that he cannot command us againſt <hi>our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:</hi> So that it is as perfectly impoſſible for us, to Obey him, and not benefit our ſelves; as to diſobey him, and not hurt our ſelves. In a word: Could you ſee this Soveraign Commander, but as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34 Or, as <hi>Iſaiah, Iſa.</hi> 6. or, as <hi>Job, Job.</hi> 42. Or, as St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9. Or, as St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1. It would be no Queſtion with you, Whether he were to be obeyed or no? Or to be obeyed preſently, or no. You would then think no <hi>Obedience</hi> great enough; no <hi>Haſt</hi> ſwift enough; no <hi>Grief</hi> for Converting no ſooner, heavy enough. <hi>O how late did I love thee,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> exclaimed. <hi>Twenty years was I a bondſlave to the Devil,</hi> cryed Mr. <hi>Jo. Machin;</hi> who was Converted in his Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year. <hi>Remember not the ſins of my Youth,</hi> ſaith the Man, who knew God's Heart better than to imagine that Youth was Lawleſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. But,</p>
            <p>R. 2. <hi>You are threatned juſt as Old People be, if you turn not unto God preſently.</hi> Therefore 'tis your Duty. Sirs, as you are not Lawleſs, ſo neither are you leſs under the Menaces and Threats of the Law-giver than other Folk be: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>The Wicked ſhall be turned into Hell.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, Old Sinners ſhall into the place of Devils: No, 'tis unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly the Wicked, all of them. Wicked <hi>Parents,</hi> and wicked <hi>Children;</hi> wicked <hi>Maſters,</hi> and <hi>wicked Scholars,</hi> or <hi>Apprentices:</hi> Every thing wicked, every Minute that you delay your Converſion, that Threat ſtands ready charged againſt your Breaſts. And who knows but God will ſhoot it off this very moment, if you Convert not this very moment? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all Sin.</hi> 'Tis not
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40119:197"/> ſaid againſt all Old Folks Sin. No, but without any reſtriction, againſt all peoples Sin. And alas! for you; did you never with your own Eyes ſee God's Wrath cut off Young Sinners? Did you never hear that in the <hi>Flood</hi> of Old, Children and Young People were drowned with the Old? And in <hi>Sodom</hi> the Young and Old Folk burned together. And that <hi>Bears</hi> tore in pieces Two and Forty little Bodies, for mocking an Holy Prophet, 2 King. 23, 24.

And in the New Teſtament he doth not tell you, that <hi>except an Old Body be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> No, but that, <hi>except a Man,</hi> any Man <hi>be born again, he cannot.</hi> Now in Scripture Language, whatever is born of a Woman, is a Man, though he be but a Span long. <hi>Vengeance muſt be taken on all that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel;</hi> all ſuch muſt be <hi>puniſhed with Everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power:</hi> Nor hath Childhood or Youth any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Come read ye then the terrible hand-Writings of God againſt you; ſo ſhall your malepert <hi>Countenances</hi> fall; your Marble <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The Threat of a fiery Furnace made by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> made all the Country, ſave Three Children of God, to bow to an Idol.</p>
            <p>What would God's Threat of ſuch a Furnace as Hell is, do, if it were but duly conſider'd? A <hi>Furnace</hi> of worſe Fire; Fire of Extremity and Eternity. A <hi>Threat</hi> of it by a Mightier Power, and more unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable Reſolution. Were theſe in your Eye, you would have much to do to hold your backs turned on God. Your Converſion muſt be haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or your Unregeneracy imbittered. You muſt be grievouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented till changed. You would ſoon, for your eaſe, crave Annihilation; or a contrary poſture to that your Souls now ſtand in toward God. You are fain to wink hard, and make your ſelves blind, to be ſo bold as to put off your Converſion. <hi>Divine Threats would bore through your Hearts, if your Luſts did not firſt bore out your Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Riſes now any thought within you, that God is very hard thus to preſs upon you? And to deny you the pleaſures of Sin, for ſuch a moment as is your Childhood, and Youth it ſelf? Beſides what will follow to ſhame it, I tell you here right. I have heard of a <hi>Devout Soul,</hi> that uſed to <hi>thank God for Hell.</hi> The thoughts of it had done him ſo much good. So much good Service againſt Sin; 'twas to him a Wall of Fire againſt Sin; a worſe Evil than Hell, the worſt thing in Hell. No ſooner ſhall your Eyes be opened, to ſee what Sin is; and what need you have of being by Fear driven from Sin; and what need of God's Threats to make you fear it; but you ſhall ſtraightway think God infinitely kind in the earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Calls, and in the terribleneſs of his Threats. I, and your Hearts ſhall tell you, that <hi>the worſt, and all that God threatens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Omnis peccator citra condignum plectitur. <hi>Sch.</hi>

               <hi>is vaſtly leſs than a minutes delay of Converſion doth deſerve from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:198"/>
            <p>R. 3. <hi>You have the Promiſes of as good things, as the Oldeſt People have, if you do Convert preſently:</hi> Therefore 'tis your Duty. The very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, without a Threat, would have made it your Duty. And ſo would his Threats, if no one Promiſe had been ſuperadded. But what think you that all do make it? Conſider ye here, God promiſes you <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Bleſſings:</hi> And the very ſame that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Converts of the fulleſt Age. And alſo with as well confirmed Promiſes; as well confirmed by his <hi>Oath,</hi> and by <hi>outward viſible Signs and Seals;</hi> or <hi>Holy Sacraments,</hi> as the Church hath long called them. A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, enough to make the leaſt Intelligent Babies ſing <hi>Hoſanna's!</hi> With Reverence to the Father of Mercies, I will ſay it; He hath no better or grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er Bleſſings to give, than he doth this Morning offer to beſtow, on all that will Convert this Morning. And on the very leaſt of you all: Neither will he think Eternity too long for your Reward, if you will not think your Life-time too long for his Service. A ſingle Minutes aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from it, deſerveth Hell: But, ſuch is his Grace through our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that in the very Minute of your ſincere Converſion, he gives you a Title to Heaven. Young People; whatever is done by Old Adders, pray do not you ſtop your Ears. I would fain have this day to be your <hi>Coronation-day;</hi> ſo it will be, if it be your <hi>Converſion-day.</hi> In Scripture dialect you are Kings and Queens, the firſt Minute that ye be Converts: Yea, and more Glorious ones, than any Unſanctified Heads that bear thoſe Names. If the greateſt Earthly Kings and Queens, knew the Vanity of their Thrones, they would gladly part with them for one Evidence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at the Heavenly one. But, wot it: <hi>If any Convert upon the Earthly Globe, did but know his Intereſt in Heaven, he muſt preſently live by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or die for Joy.</hi> So weighty is the Crown of Grace it ſelf: So over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming a Glory, unto us in the Body. You are ready to think, this is too good to be true. But hear ye then the moſt ſure word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. The ſelf-ſame Promiſe is to Fathers and Children. The Covenant of Grace is but one for both. Of the ſame Promiſes to them, as of the ſame Demands from them. And ask ye, what in this Covenant is Promiſed? I tell you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. God promiſes <hi>to be the God</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Convert, 1 Cor. 3.21. <hi>That all things</hi> (deſirable) <hi>ſhall be theirs. Luke</hi> 15.31. It is his own Word; and as large an one as Infinite Bounty it ſelf can ſpeak, <hi>All that I have is thine.</hi> Pardoning <hi>Grace</hi> and Purifying is promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 12. <hi>An Inheritance Incorruptible, reſerved in Heaven,</hi> is promiſed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. The <hi>Neceſſaries of the Life that now is,</hi> are promiſed, enough to bear your Charge to Heaven. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. An <hi>entail of Bleſſing on your deareſt ones,</hi> is promiſed <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p>The Promiſes of all theſe are by God confirmed unto you in your Baptiſm. You have them Signed and Sealed by God's hand before you know your right hand from your left. So very early God encourages you to Hope in him, and Convert unto him. By Signed, Sealed Promiſe, <hi>David,</hi> ſayes, God did <hi>make him to hope when he was on his Mothers Breaſts:</hi> And was <hi>his God from his Mothers Belly.</hi> I can underſtand him no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:40119:198"/> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9, 10. God foreſtalled the World and Devil; bound <hi>David</hi> ſo to him before they could come at him to entice him away. Laid in that ſuperabundant ground of Hope and Engagement unto all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beforehand, that as ſoon as he came to Capacity of Underſtanding, he ſhould not want for Attractives of his Affection to Convert and Cleave to God. And no otherwiſe doth God deal with you. You that know what your Baptiſm means, do know ſo much. Now, no ſooner do you Underſtand, Conſent unto, and Profeſs the Imports of your <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but God calls you to his <hi>Holy Table.</hi> There to confirm again and again with great frequency, all the foreſaid Promiſes. O ye height, length, bredth and depth of the Divine <hi>Munificence</hi> and Kindneſs! The <hi>Bleſſing of Abraham,</hi> and every Iota of it, comes on every ſincere Convert, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Speak Sirs; is God ſo ill a Maſter, that no offer can perſwade you to return unto him? Or, What is there more than God has offered, that you deſire? Or what further Confirmation and Ratification of his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than he gives, do you crave? Or, (which is that I liſten after;) will you now ſtraitway turn unto him? And here right, take on the Spiritual <hi>Robe, the Ring, and the Shoes!</hi> And make Joy in Heaven and in this Congregation! I do hope, the Sun ſhall not go down, before ſome of you are reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>I have heard of a ſinful Boy that offered to Convert preſently, if a Friend of his could make it out to him, that he ſhould fare the better for it in his Body and things of this Life. Which being done, he did Convert, and lived and dyed an eminent Saint. I am aware there is much of that Boys Spirit in all young People. And it likes me to try whether I may ſo draw you with the Conſiderations that drew him. Hear then what I ſay to evince, that Converſion is a very Friend unto good <hi>Health, Eſtate, Mirth,</hi> and <hi>Name;</hi> that the ſtate of Grace, is, in reſpect of theſe like the City <hi>Triocala;</hi> one of Water-ſprings ſweeteſt, Vineyards choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, and Rocks moſt impregnable. That when you once enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, your wants will be of nothing but things worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and wherever you are lodged, the worſt of your Wounds will be but Flea bites: Or however ye are wounded, ye can never be hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Health,</hi> is the Salt and ſweeteſt Sawce of Life. 'Tis Sin, (Peoples own, or their Anceſtors, or both) that ordinarily is the <hi>working</hi> cauſe, as well as <hi>deſerving</hi> cauſe of ſickneſs. The Spirit, and Grace, and Service of God, every way make for Health. Particularly, Temperance and good Conſcience are the moſt ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gn of all things unto your Blood and Spirits: And Converting Grace is not it ſelf without them. Go ask Phyſicians, they will tell you; <hi>Luxury and Lechery</hi> do make them an hundred Patients, for every one that is made them by <hi>Faſting and Prayer.</hi> No Precept of Chriſt is for any Duty, (Faſting it ſelf,) unto Sickneſs; if his precepts were obſerved, they would prevent more, than ever his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles healed. If a good Man be at any time ſo weak, as to <hi>hate his own Fleſh;</hi> he is not led to it by God's Spirit. He ought indeed to <hi>beat it down,</hi> and <hi>keep it in ſubjection to Gods Law;</hi> and from the Uſurpation of
<pb facs="tcp:40119:199"/> ſinful Luſts. But withal, 'tis thoſe <hi>Luſts</hi> he is to mortifie, and not <hi>his Body.</hi> A Convert's Body, is the Holy Ghoſt's <hi>Temple.</hi> And if ſo, be ſure God will be kind unto it, and his Servants ought to be duly careful of it.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Eſtate,</hi> is a very uſeful Hedge about you; to keep off thoſe many Proud, that will be trampling upon all that is Poor. And nothing raiſes or keeps up this Hedge, like the Grace of God. For it ſpirits you with <hi>Diligence</hi> which gets Riches; with <hi>Humility,</hi> which hates ſuperfluity, and ſaveth what is got; with <hi>Charity,</hi> which puts out all to Uſe; and unto that Lord who never pays leſs than an hundred Fold in this Life it ſelf. Sin is this Hedge-breaker. Rags are moſtly Sins Livery. When 'tis otherwiſe; and Sin makes you a Hedge, it will be full of Snakes and Snares. In the fullneſs of ſinful ſufficience, you will be in ſtraits. And 'tis odds, but the Straits will be long, and the Fullneſs a very little while. On the other hand, when a Converts Duty to God makes him poor, it makes him rather a <hi>Martyr</hi> than a <hi>Beggar.</hi> For he thereby teſtifies God's Truth; and through the Truth of God to his Covenant, he abounds in the middle of his wants. For God doth but prune his Vines; he burns up none but Thorns. By Poverty he may undo Sinners, but he ſtill enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Saints. <hi>Do but Convert, you can never want what is truly good for you, while God has it.</hi> The firſt Minute that a great Eſtate begins to be good for you, you ſhall have it. And if you never have a <hi>Great</hi> one, you ſhall ſtill have a <hi>Good</hi> one. Whereas Unconverts can have but one of theſe two; a <hi>vexing Adverſity,</hi> or (what is worſe,) a <hi>ſlaying Proſperity.</hi> One made of thick Clay, and deeper Cares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mirth and Comfort</hi> are the Hony and Sweetneſs of your Beings. Now Converſion makes <hi>exchange,</hi> but no <hi>Robbery</hi> of theſe. There is in <hi>Africa</hi> an Hony luſciouſly ſweet, but the Bees gather it from poyſonous Weeds, and it affects with madneſs and Frenzy all that eat of it. He were no Thief that ſhould take that ſort of Hony from you, and give the moſt wholeſom to you. Converſion deals no otherwiſe by you. Only what it gives, is more ſweet as more wholſom. And the quantity greater, as well as the quality better. For, obſerve ye, God forbids not any one <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi> of pleaſures, but what is injurious. And what your very <hi>Nature, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> do forbid you. I deny it not; Converts have Valleys of Troubles; but then they have doors of Hope. They are in Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; but God prepares them Tables therein. Dryeſt Rocks yield them Water; and in darkeſt Dungeons they have ſhining Lights: They receive here their Evil things, and have their Hell upon Earth; but then 'tis a Heaven upon Earth, to think this is all the Hell they ſhall ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. And as for the Wayes he commandeth Converts to walk in, they are all of Pleaſantneſs. Myſteriouſly, yet moſt certainly, Godly ſorrow is made a ſweet thing. <hi>Every Week almoſt have I People crying for more of it, than I think God allows them.</hi> O Youth, <hi>ſcies cum fies;</hi> when thou art a Convert, thou ſhalt feel what I tell thee: No ſuch <hi>Manna</hi> falls in <hi>Calabria;</hi> none falls from Heaven, like that which feaſteth the Camps of ſincere Converts. <hi>The Convert ſtate hath of the Joy as well as of the Purity of Heaven;</hi> Unthought of Delights: Such as don't Dye
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40119:199"/> in the Enjoyment. No, but be <hi>stronger than Death,</hi> as well as <hi>ſweeter than Life.</hi> Such as none of the Buſie-bodies of this World ever found in the <hi>Mills</hi> of their Buſineſs, or the <hi>Circles</hi> of their pleaſure. <hi>Gilboa</hi>'s Mountains had not Rain or Dew. Unconvert Youths, have not Joy or Peace. Madneſs is theirs; Mirth they know not. The three <hi>Hebrew Martyrs</hi> were merrier in the fiery Furnace, than their Perſecutor was in his Palace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Name and Honour</hi> be your precious Oyntments. The things that make you cheerful in your ſelves, grateful and uſeful unto others. True, I would rather my own Heart ſhould commend me than all the World's Mouth beſide. Next to Gods own praiſe of us, the praiſe of a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Conſcience, is the moſt deſirable. Nevertheleſs mens good eſteem, good mens eſpecially, is uſeful to the foreſaid purpoſes. And your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is requiſite thereto. For 'tis the King of Heaven is the true <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Honour;</hi> and he maketh Converts, and no others, <hi>Veſſels of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Honour, both below and above! Hypocrites know this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the praiſe of men they make an outſide Converſion to God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts do know this; and therefore by all the Reproaches of Men will not be beaten off from the way of God. <hi>Plato</hi> could ſay, <hi>a wicked man was the Earths vilest Dunghill; and a Religious one, its moſt ſacred Temple.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law,</hi> we know that God would have thoſe that touch'd a dead Man, to be held unclean ſeven times as long as thoſe that touch'd a dead Beaſt. So teaching, how debaſed and defiled a thing an <hi>ill man</hi> is, more than a <hi>brute Creature.</hi> What need words? who be thoſe that you ſee earthly Potentates advance to Honours, but their true, zealous, and active Friends? Turn you truly, zealouſly, actively to the King immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; he ſhall forthwith love you more than any of his Angels can love him! And that love it ſelf ſhall be a crown of Honour enough to make all the <hi>Divels</hi> in Hell envy you; many of the worlds <hi>Hypocrites</hi> wiſh themſelves in your ſtate; and all the <hi>Saints</hi> of God with holy Angels to prize you beyond expreſſion, and without Flattery. Every convert, whether he conſider it or no, hath a name greater than of Earls and Dukes. God writeth them that give up their names unto him, <hi>Princes in all Lands</hi> and <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto him for ever. Pſal</hi> 45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. Indeed the world counts them and tramples on them as dirt: but God calls them and will make them up as Jewels. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. with Mat. 3.17. The world's Duſts, be God's Diamonds. If then the beſt things of both worlds can oblige, you ſee your ſelves obliged to Turn preſently unto God.</p>
            <p>R. 4. <hi>You are convinced by your own Conſciences, as truly as other people be, that you ought preſently to turn unto God.</hi> Therefore 'tis Duty Young people; God's Commands, Threats, and Promiſes do oblige, whether you learn, and know, and mind them, or not. Your Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Unbelief cannot make them of <hi>no</hi> effect; though to your ſelves, they may eaſily make them of <hi>very ill</hi> effect. But when the kindneſs of God brings them unto your Knowledge and Thoughts; when he ſets Conſcience which is his <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> and <hi>Deputy</hi> in your Souls, to the work; and makes it in your very Heart and Reins to Command his Commands, to Promiſe his Promiſes, and to Threaten his Threats: what think you
<pb facs="tcp:40119:200"/> then? Believe it, then he accounts your <hi>Engagement</hi> to be heighthened with your <hi>Advantage.</hi> And he ſtands up for the Honour and Reverence of Conſcience; the Honour of which he takes for your utmoſt Honour of himſelf, and Contempt of which he takes for your utmoſt Contempt of him. And, if now it appear that his <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> Conſcience, hath been contemned; and you have ſinned againſt the Edicts and Commands thereof; your ſin then is <hi>exceeding ſinful</hi> in his Eyes. Then have you broken <hi>many,</hi> yea all his Bonds; and muſt be beaten with <hi>many,</hi> yea the worſt of his ſtripes. The Conſcience then which you would not have to be your <hi>Ruler,</hi> ſhall be your <hi>Tormentor.</hi> Sooner or later, it ſhall.</p>
            <p>What plead you therefore? Which of you all can look me in the Face, and ſay that your Conſciences are convinced of no ſuch thing? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever Witneſſes I do bring, your Conſciences are none, unto the Truth of my Doctrine. You are <hi>Men,</hi> and not Brutes. You are <hi>Engliſh people</hi> too. You live where the Goſpel ſhines. And I muſt tell you, I nothing doubt but <hi>the Holy Ghoſt beams in Light very early into Engliſh Children.</hi> Light, convincing them of the Neceſſity of Converſion, and of the Malignity of Procraſtination. I would be underſtood eſpecially of the Children of Religious Parents; and ſuch as are carried to hear Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that do underſtand and preach Chriſtianity, and not ſcoff at all <hi>Regeneration</hi> beſide <hi>Baptiſmal;</hi> and do not diſpenſe <hi>Stones for Bread, and Serpents for Fiſh.</hi> But do give Babes <hi>ſincere Milk;</hi> deſigning to <hi>Edifie,</hi> not to <hi>Amuſe</hi> them.</p>
            <p>All ſuch as are like to Hear or Read my Labors, I would ask theſe Queſtions. 1. Think you not, that your Minds, Wills, and practick Powers, were given to you to Know, Love, and Serve your God? 2. That you are bound from your firſt Capacity, to exerciſe them thereunto? 3. That in order to your ſo Exerciſing them, 'tis incumbent on you, to go learn the Goſpel-Covenant; and <hi>Accept</hi> it's gracious offers; and <hi>Rely</hi> on its Promiſes; and <hi>Purpoſe, Promiſe and Vow,</hi> by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, from this time for ever to be the Lords? 4. That Haſte hereto is your Duty, and Delay is Sin, very manifold Sin? 5. That preſent Converſion, will be unto the preſent Pardon and Mortification of all Sin; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of it, will keep every ſin Unpardoned; Mortifie no ſin, but give a growing ſtrength unto all? 6. That preſent Converſion is moſt Honour to God, benefit unto your ſelves, joy to your pious Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am ſo far from ſuſpecting the more grown of you, that I have ſatisfactory grounds to believe, that moſt of five ſix and ſeven years old, do, in their hearts, believe all. Yea, and have their Conſciences oft-times telling them theſe things, as Parents and Miniſters are inculking of them. As St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of <hi>Seneca,</hi> I dare ſay of moſt of you, youngeſt ones. You make much of what you think nothing worth; and declaim againſt that which you do above all prefer in your heart.</p>
            <p>However can you chuſe but ſee, that you all who are convinced, are all extraordinarily obliged to convert preſently? 'Tis infinitely the Duty of all; but yours it would be, if poſſible, more than infinitely. No man muſt tell me Regeneration is a great Myſtery, above Childrens reach; and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:40119:200"/> therefore, for all my Confidence, I do miſtake them. Well I know, <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Myſtery, of the greateſt;</hi> but I deny, that the Neceſſity of it is a Myſtery. That is of the plaineſt principles. And I utterly deny, that ſo young Children as I have named, are uncapable of Underſtanding as much of Converſion, as God will accept of from them. Know it, O little ones; <hi>Give God your All, he will not reject it as little; give him your Beſt, he will accept it as little good as is in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But oh greater and leſſer of you, hear and fear! Hell gapes for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying Unconverts. And, of any, is likeſt to ſwallow up thoſe, whoſe delays are againſt Convictions. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſays, St. <hi>Paul</hi> dealt more ſeverely with the <hi>Galatians</hi> than the <hi>Romans</hi> for the ſame fault. Becauſe the <hi>Galatians</hi> had been fore-inſtructed, and ſinned againſt more Light. In all the Bible, though it be an Hiſtory of more then Four Thouſand Years, we read of but <hi>one</hi> that converted juſt before his Death. And we do believe that he alſo did convert at his firſt convincing-call. <hi>Rarely do any ſavingly Convert, who do not upon their first convictions Convert.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ſtifled Convictions coſt him dear. You that will make ſo bold with Conſcience as <hi>Spira</hi> did, ſhould expect to roar for it here as he did; or hereafter to fare worſe than many hope him to do. They are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Divines, who are not hopeleſs of his Salvation.</p>
            <p>R. 5. <hi>You dye and go to Judgment, as ordinarily in your young dayes, as others in their older.</hi> Therefore 'tis your Duty to convert preſently. Come ſtand forth the livelieſt Spark of you all, and tell us if you can, that no body was ever known to dye at your Years. Or, if there did, your Life is no ſuch <hi>Vapor,</hi> your <hi>Fleſh</hi> no ſuch graſs as theirs. You know our Weekly <hi>Bills of Mortality</hi> would ſhame you. And the great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of <hi>Graves of all ſorts</hi> every where. You do know your own vanity in putting far from your <hi>Minds,</hi> the fatal day that cannot be thruſt off one Minute from your <hi>Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an undenyable Truth; <hi>the day of Life and of Grace be not always of a Length.</hi> And that if they were, that could be no warrant for delaying the work of your Salvation. But one would think your Life's uncertainty it ſelf, if conſidered, ſhould be of weight enough to preſs you unto haſt. And make your wilful delay as <hi>impoſſible</hi> unto you, as 'tis <hi>Impious.</hi> For, you are not <hi>Papists.</hi> And if you were; Prayers for you after death, you could not think regularly to obtain. They do not hold it lawful to pray for any after their death, that do not Repent and Convert in their Life. <hi>If you dye unconverted, your Fathers and Mothers are taught to conſent to your being damned. And the best Friends you have, be forbid to pray for your being took out of Hell, or your being cooled in it.</hi> You do not imagine, I hope, that a cold drying, <hi>God be merciful to you,</hi> juſt before death, is a ſaving Converſion. If it were, we might ſay Heaven is the receptacle of the <hi>moſt</hi> and <hi>worſt</hi> of men And a great part of the Scripture is took up in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring our needleſs Labor. But, we are well ſure of the contrary. Though you ought to be told alſo; that if it were really ſo, yet were your delay ſtill a prodigious Folly. Being of your ability to utter thoſe words at your death, you are as uncertain, as of any thing. And you
<pb facs="tcp:40119:201"/> have little reaſon to think, that your preſent <hi>Obstinacy</hi> ſhall not then be puniſhed with (at leaſt) <hi>Impotency.</hi> 
               <q>Oh <hi>Death,</hi> of <hi>Judgment!</hi> come look you in the Faces of theſe ſecure young Folks! Shew your ſelves unto them; ask them, whether upon ſight of you, they can think two or three broken words preparation enough for your Terrors? And that it can be time enough to think of peace with God, when Pain will not let men be able to think three thoughts together of him.</q> I knew an excellent Perſon that uſed to Exclaim, <hi>O Lord, Pain will not let one think upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>R. 6. <hi>You, as much as elder people, are abſurd in your promiſes to Convert hereafter.</hi> Therefore it is your Duty to Convert preſently. It is no eaſie thing to aſcend to the height of Atheiſm; in which alone you can dare ſay, There is no God; or, None that you are bound penitently to convert unto: or, You will not, whatever follows, ever Turn to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you muſt be dumb or find ſomewhat elſe to ſay. Very many I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Harbor in them a <hi>dumb Devil;</hi> and to ſay little to themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters between God and their Souls. But many there are, in whom Conſcience will not be ſo eaſily muzzled. But will have ſomewhat ſaid, or elſe give no quiet. For want of all things beſide, this is ſaid, Hereafter I will convert.</p>
            <p>But who has bewitch'd hearers of the Goſpel? Neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf, knows any way to Heaven by a delayed Converſion. The Law requires <hi>continuing,</hi> the Goſpel requires <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Perſevering;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admit of <hi>Delaying. Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed be every one,</hi> (young and old) <hi>that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</hi> Did you not only Intend, but Begin; and that this preſent minute; not only to wiſh but to do; not only ſome but all things of the Law? The Law for all this, would damn you without Mercy, for having ever ceaſed to do all. <hi>Glory be to God in the highest, for the bleſſed Goſpel!</hi> And what ſays that? Why, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Thou art a ſinner; a ſinner grievous againſt Law, Goſpel, and Conſcience. But what then? Believe now on the Lord Jeſus; Turn to God by him dutifully, God will draw nigh to thee graciouſly: But neither there or any where is it ſaid, If thou art not minded to believe preſently, do but promiſe hereafter to do it, thou ſhalt be ſaved. And for your lives, young People, conſider (after <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi>) but <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Preſidents.</hi> When Chriſt call'd his Diſciples, all follow'd him preſently. VVhen the Three Thouſand were preached to, and were convinced, they were converted preſently. So the Jailor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. converted ſtraitway.</p>
            <p>But look we a little into theſe your words, you will convert hereafter. Fall they not into theſe two parts? 1. <hi>We will not Convert now.</hi> 2. <hi>We will hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>You will not Convert now.</hi> That is, You will abide <hi>Rebels</hi> to God, <hi>Devils</hi> to your ſelf, <hi>Vaſſals</hi> to the Devil, <hi>Idolizers</hi> of this vain VVorld, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This you will do; though you know it <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſafe, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful,</hi> and all that is worſt. And though you would
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:40119:201"/> think it hard, if God ſhould hold you in ſuch a ſtate, againſt your Wills. Or ſuffer Satan to keep you in it by force. This you will do, though you know if God ſhould now uſe you like your ſelves, (that is, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable Enemies, even againſt his very intreaties;) you muſt be ſent quick to Hell. Though you know too, that every ſin you commit, makes Converſion harder, if ever it be made; and Hell hotter for you, if it be not made. This ye will do; of Choice you will. And becauſe you will; without any Reaſons that you dare to produce, or let mortal Men hear you ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>You will Convert hereafter.</hi> Thy <hi>Power,</hi> Fooliſh Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thy <hi>Power!</hi> Where is thy <hi>Power,</hi> thy <hi>Will,</hi> or thy <hi>Reaſon!</hi> Thy <hi>Power</hi> Man! Canſt thou live as long as thou wilt? Or, canſt thou keep what ability God has now given thee for Converſion, and make it more when thou wilt? Canſt thou ſave thy ſelf from Diſtraction? Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Art thou able thy ſelf to ſupply thy ſelf with neceſſaries Natural and Supernatural, now and hereafter? Well: if thou couldeſt, ſay plainly what is thy <hi>Will?</hi> 'Tis a Will, not moved by Gods Threats or Promiſes to Fear or Love him. If it were ſo, thou wouldſt Convert now. And if it be not ſo, what is thy <hi>Purpoſe,</hi> for all thy fair <hi>Promiſe?</hi> Doſt intend hereafter to turn unto a God neither Feared nor Loved? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou doſt not. Thinkeſt thou that thou ſhalt hereafter Fear and Love him? I ask what ſhould make thee ſo think? He will for ever be the ſame God that now he is. Lay to thy Heart, what I tell thee, <hi>If God be not juſt now worthy of Fear and Love, then he never was or will be ſo; for he Changes not.</hi> In a word: VVhat if thou hadſt both power to Convert when thou wouldeſt, and hadſt a real will to Convert hereafter to God; where is the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> for ſtaying without and againſt God all the while? Thou art Servant, he is Lord; thou the Child, he the Father. When Servants run away and will not return to their Maſters: and very Children run away, and will not come back to their Fathers! No, though the Maſters and Fathers call and ſend and promiſe; and do not need them, while they all the while need their Maſters and Fathers. All people conclude there is a cauſe of this: and a fault muſt lie ſomewhere in one of the Parties. Either the Fathers Unnatural, and the Maſter Cruel; or elſe the Child is a Viper, and the Servant a Monſter. Speak, Man, and ſay now: where is the fault, what is the cauſe that thou canſt not yet be prevailed with to return to thy Lord and Father? Thou muſt charge Him or thy ſelf with moſt black and bloody faults. If thou lay'ſt it on God, thou makeſt him worſe than the Devil; and proclaimeſt Satan the better Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Father of the two. If thou takeſt the blame on thy ſelf; I ask thee, how thou canſt endure to ſee, hear, or think of thy ſelf? A Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hating it's God, that is all Love and all Lovelineſs! No words, I think: no words of mine I am ſure, can expreſs how <hi>Blasphemous,</hi> or how <hi>Self-condemned</hi> they are, all, that put off Converſion to another time.</p>
            <p>Alas, here is Life and all in the caſe. Converſion, is the Life of thy Soul, Man. 'Tis Dying, till it Convert. 'Tis in Hell, till thou Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.
<pb facs="tcp:40119:202"/> And is this a fit word, <hi>I will then Convert hereafter?</hi> Thy darling Child drops into the Fire, and thou promiſeſt to come help it out to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. A very <hi>Kind</hi> creature thou wilt be thought, and as <hi>Wiſe</hi> an one. Upon every account I may ſay of theſe Promiſes of Turning hereafter, as was ſaid of <hi>Judas, It had been better they had never been born.</hi> And they be <hi>Judaſſes</hi> indeed; for though they Flatter and Kiſs, they Betray and Kill poor Souls.</p>
            <p>R. 7. <hi>You, as plainly as elder people do dare God to damn you, all the while you delay your Converſion.</hi> Therefore 'tis your duty to convert pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. I have heard of a Man much accuſtomed to curſing in his health, that could not utter any word but a curſe in his ſickneſs. Could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Yes or No; but as oft as he ſpoke, in ſeveral Months time, he bid God to damn him. A moſt frightful thing, you will ſay! And yet, young people, I take you to be in very like condition, all that delay your Converſion.</p>
            <p>For the Language of Practice is, with God and Men, as ſignificant as any! if not more. If you <hi>practically</hi> bid God damn you, you are of the ſame ſpirit with them who <hi>verbally</hi> bid him ſo do. And, if I know any thing, Delayers do bid him in deeds, as certainly as any ſinners do in their words. I appeal to your very own thoughts in the caſe;</p>
            <p>You are corrupted with ſin and condemned for it. The grace of God calls you to come take your <hi>Pardon</hi> and your <hi>Cure.</hi> But tells you, <hi>Now is your Time.</hi> Promiſes you no Breath of Life, but what's in your Noſtrils; nor any offer of Cure or Pardon, after the firſt. In every Precept, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires preſent coming. Your Delaying, therefore, is running the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And that adventuring is plain ſaying, <q>Lord, if now, <hi>juſt now,</hi> be the time, I ſhall not take hold of it. Though I Burn, I will not yet Turn. Thou doſt not promiſe to ſtay longer for me; but, if thou wilt not, Damn and do thy worſt with me. I would rather thou wouldſt change thy Word. Blot <hi>[now in the dayes of thy Youth]</hi> out of the Bible: Write <hi>[Remember thy Creator when thou art old and bedridden.]</hi> But, if this thou wilt not do, I will live under thy Threatning VVrath. And let its Vials fall on me, if they muſt; I am ſet againſt preſent Converſion for thy Peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let me add but this, Sirs! There is but one way poſſible to Hell; which is by Sin. For nothing elſe can incenſe God againſt You. He cannot be in the leaſt diſpleaſed for ought beſide. But, ſin is that which he cannot but Hate and Puniſh. Now <hi>to go on wilfully, delightfully, and reſolutely in ſin, is in effect as if you ſhould kneel down on your knees, and beg, and pray, with tears in your eyes, that you may never be ſaved. But may be aſſured of a place in the loweſt Hell.</hi> The former, is interpretatively the latter. O madneſs beyond compare! though not Admired, becauſe ſo much Practiſed.</p>
            <p>R. 8. <hi>You, as well as Elder people, do hate and rob God, and imitate and obey Satan, till you do Convert.</hi> Therefore 'tis your duty preſently to Convert. Young people, it may be you know not what you do; but knowingly or ignorantly, theſe things you do do, till you Convert. You
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40119:202"/> 
               <hi>hate</hi> God; <hi>Interpretatively,</hi> you hate him. By your actions, no other can be judged of you. If you deſired to expreſs hatred of him, you could not take a more direct way for it, then that you are in. For you walk contrary unto him. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> you hate him. If you have any love to him, ſure it's nothing, and leſs than nothing, in compariſon of that which you bear unto your idolized things and perſons. Yea, <hi>Abſolutely</hi> you hate him, as an holy and juſt Ruler and Judge. In his Government you hate him; and wiſh you could dethrone him. Deny it, if you dare. In his Children and Friends you hate him. Their Company is an Eye-ſore and Burthen unto you; his Image on them you cannot bear. If it were otherwiſe, you could not but Convert unto him. You <hi>Rob</hi> him, yea, and all his. You rob him of a <hi>Child,</hi> Chriſt of a <hi>Member,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt of a <hi>Temple,</hi> the Heavenly Hoſt of a <hi>Joy,</hi> the Church of a <hi>Star,</hi> the World of a <hi>Pillar.</hi> And in the mean time, what do you? VVhy Satan in the God of every unconvert Creature. Him in your Spiritual impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you <hi>Imitate;</hi> in your bodily, you <hi>Obey;</hi> in both, you <hi>Serve and Gratifie.</hi> Horrid Servitude! Unendurable by Souls and jod leſs ſenſeleſs than Plants, or leſs wild than Brutes!</p>
            <p>R. 9. <hi>You, as elder People, do out-ſin Satan himſelf till you do Convert.</hi> Therefore it muſt needs be your Duty to Convert preſently. Sirs, muſe on it. 'Tis Sin, and the higheſt, to ſlight the richeſt offers of Divine Grace. You that Convert not, do ſlight ſuch offers as be the kindeſt God ever made to men. And ſuch as he never did offer unto faln Angels. Ye do not believe, that the Devils and damned ghoſts in Hell would ſlight them ſo, if God ſhould make the ſame offer unto them. I mean, provided they were not under irrevocable damnatory Sentence, and alſo final Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and implacable Malice; the which you are not under. You would then think, that, if the Goſpel were preach'd unto them, they would not ſay as you do virtually ſay, every day of the week: <hi>ſc.</hi> 
               <q>Lord we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hearken at preſent to thy propoſals. VVe will, at ſome more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient ſeaſon. Or, if thou wilt not wait that leiſure of ours, then will we go without thy offered Kindneſs.</q> No, I ſuppoſe you would think, that they would rather anſwer thus, which you have not yet done. <q>Lord, our <hi>aſtoniſhed Minds</hi> never heard ſo raviſhing News. Our <hi>enflamed Hearts</hi> cannot contain their Praiſe or Thanks. VVe are not able to utter faſt enough our Acceptation of thy <hi>Offers,</hi> or our Conſent unto thy <hi>Demands.</hi> VVe would celebrate the Grace of both; but who can expreſs things Infinite? The Eloquence of Heaven is exceeded by it's Kings Mercy; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs; I muſt have you Convert preſently, or muſt have leave to ſay, <hi>You are of your Father the Devil, and the works of your Father you will do;</hi> and worſe, if worſe can be. But though I thus ſpeak, I would by no means have you think any good to be in the Devil. Only I would have you know, there is much more evil in your ſelves, than you are aware of. And that <hi>you can never know your Sin too much, if you do not know your Saviour too little.</hi> VVherefore I add,</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:203"/>
            <p>R. 10. <hi>You, Young People, do ſin beyond the meaſure of all Old ones that Convert not, if you put off your Converſion.</hi> Therefore it is your Duty, and you are ſingularly obliged to Convert preſently.</p>
            <p>This Reaſon gives me opportunity, to ſlide into the very heart of the caſe propounded unto me. I do conſider with whom I have to do, and ſhall thus plainly and even rudely make my way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The meaſure of their ſins is far greateſt, who do then ſin, when the Lions in the way of their Duty, be feweſt, and their Helps be moſt, and their Encouragements greateſt.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Young People, not Converting unto God, have this to be ſaid concerning their ſin: That it is committed then, when feweſt Lions, be in the way of their Duty, when their Helps to it be the moſt of any Mens, and their Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments greateſt.</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sin of Young People not Converting is far greateſt. And ſo far from being to be extenuated and thought leſs of than Old Peoples, that it ought to be held, of the two the greater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſuppoſe my Work here requiſite to be only this, <hi>viz</hi> to ſhew that Young People have <hi>ordinarily</hi> fewer Diſcouragements from going about to Convert, than Old ones have. And have moſt Helps than they; and greater Encouragements than Old People now have; and then they themſelves can have when they become Old. I ſay, <hi>Ordinarily.</hi> For which Service, I advance theſe <hi>Seven Conſiderations.</hi> Directing them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelves, my Young Folk.</p>
            <p>C. 1. <hi>Your God is not ſo angry with you, as he is with Older People, and will be with you, if you Convert not before you are Older.</hi> He is indeed angry with you; for Sin <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actual.</hi> Go rowl you in the Duſt before him. Yet, know for your Comfort, he is leſs angry, as I have ſaid. For, theſe two Aſſertions are moſt true. Sc. (1.) <hi>Every day conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in refuſal of Subjection to his Authority, and every wilful refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Obedience unto his Goſpel Precepts, do increaſe the Fire of God's Indignation.</hi> (2.) <hi>Every laſt day of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſubjection, and every laſt Act of Diſobedience, do increaſe that Fire of God's Indignation more than the former.</hi> As for the firſt, though it be Self-evident, and granted of all Men, let me add this. A Command, ſuppoſes <hi>Authority</hi> in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and <hi>Subjection</hi> in the Commanded. Obedience unto a Command ſuppoſes <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of Authority in him that gives, and Subjection in him that receive it. God is Soveraign, we are Subjects. He firſt publiſhes his Authority, and requires our <hi>Subjection:</hi> Then enacts Laws, and requires our <hi>Obedience.</hi> Our <hi>Orderly Duty is, to ſubmit us firſt to his Authority,</hi> and own him for our God and King; <hi>and then to perform his Commands,</hi> for expreſſing that Submiſſion. The Sin of the World that incenſes God, is denyal of this Submiſſion to him, and of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it. Of this Denyal, the firſt riſe and <hi>beginning</hi> kindles his Wrath; but the <hi>continuance,</hi> againſt his means of reducing us unto Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Obedience, doth more than continue it. Even <hi>greatly encreaſe</hi> it. Nor is it wonder, being that the ſinful Denyal, continued under ſuch conſtant means aforeſaid, dayly encreaſeth. And accordingly, <hi>barren Trees have it counted to them, how many years they have cumbred the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40119:203"/> ground.</hi> But then, as to the ſecond particular: Therefore doth every laſt days Unſubmiſſion and Diſobedience more exaſperate then the former, becauſe they are againſt more <hi>Means</hi> uſed, and <hi>Patience</hi> exerciſed, then the former. And they are as it were a <hi>Juſtifying,</hi> and an Approving of all former Sin alſo. A virtual <hi>Acting</hi> over of all again.</p>
            <p>There can therefore be no doubt but the degree of God's Diſpleaſure is leſs againſt you, than againſt thoſe who have many more years <hi>Diſowned</hi> and <hi>Diſobeyed him.</hi> And you have leſs reaſon to <hi>fear</hi> the making of your Peace with him, if you go ſeek it, then they have. And more ground of <hi>hope</hi> to get it made now, then you can have hereafter if you delay. For you to ſay, I will not ſeek my Peace till I am Older, is as if a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Man ſhould ſay, <q>I will not go try to get my Pardon, till the King is a hundred-fold more angry with me than yet he is. Matchleſs Frenzie!</q>
            </p>
            <p>C. 2. <hi>Your Enemy Satan, has not ſo much Power over you, as he hath over Older People; and will have over you, if you Convert not before you are Older.</hi> Sirs, Satan is an Enemy that you muſt Conquer, or be Deſtroyed by. His Power to Deceive, is very great. It was ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſhewn in Paradiſe to be ſo, when he ſlew all Mankind in their firſt Parents. Beſides, it is now much greater. In more than Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, he has learned much. And being now an <hi>Old,</hi> he is a more <hi>Subtle</hi> Serpent. But it is not his <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Acquired</hi> Power, without that which is <hi>Judicial,</hi> that is the matter of our juſt Fear. The <hi>Lyon in Chains</hi> ſcareth no Child: 'Tis <hi>the Lyon let looſe</hi> that frightens the Town, and doth the Miſchief. All Satans Power, is no Power as to us, if God doth not judiciouſly let him looſe on us. God, as he is more or leſs angry with Men, holds up Satan in a longer or ſhorter Chain. Being leſs Angry with you, Young People; he ſuffers him not to fall upon you with ſuch ſtrength of Fraud or Force, as upon Old Tranſgreſſors. So much reach at you God doth allow him, as maketh needful your Watching and Prayer, and Warineſs of his Devices. But God allows him ſo very much leſs at you, than at others, that he may be repelled more eaſily by you, than others: And you have leſs reaſon to <hi>doubt</hi> of Victory when you fight againſt him, than others have. And may be certain, that if you abide Unconvert in your ſins, and go on to incenſe God more againſt you, you ſhall then have a much more powerful Enemy of him than now you have. Now,</p>
            <p>Would any General of an Army delay to Fight with his Enemy, till he himſelf were Weaker, and his Enemies ſtronger? O do not any of you ſay practically, <q>I will not yet fight for my Tranſlation out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs; I will have the Prince of Darkneſs get an Hundred times more forces againſt me, and more advantagious ground, before I will encounter him How kind to Satan, are Delaying Children?</q>
            </p>
            <p>C. 3. <hi>Your Hearts, which are your Rulers under God, be not yet ſo bad within you, as Old Peoples be; and as they will themſelves be ſure to be if you now Convert not.</hi> Your Hearts, the Lord ſhew it you, are they that do moſt under God, for your Conquering, or your being Conquered by
<pb facs="tcp:40119:204"/> Sin, Death, and Hell. Theſe Hearts of yours be blind and fooliſh, proud and perverſe enough; they be ſufficiently Unteachable, Untractable, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. The Lord humble you deeply in the deepeſt ſenſe of it. But ſtill, they be not near ſo bad as Old Sinners Hearts be. Believe it, there is a ſenſe, in which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his words be ſmart: <hi>How can a Man be born when he is Old? God</hi> has in his Offence, departed farther from Old Men than you. <hi>Satan</hi> in his long ſtay in them, has hammered them into a greater hardneſs than he has yet brought you into. <hi>Actual Sins,</hi> have put more ſtrength into their Habitual, than into Yours. And they have more Milſtones about the neck of their Souls, than yet are about yours. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that you have as much the better of them, as thoſe who have in War a leſs unqualified Commanded, have of them whoſe Leader is moſt blind, moſt Lame, and moſt Lunatick it ſelf. Your Work is <hi>more eaſie,</hi> and your Encouragement to expect Victory is <hi>more ample,</hi> than Old Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And both ſuch, as they will not continue unto you, unleſs you now Convert unto God.</p>
            <p>Which if you do not, you do like Soldiers that ſhould ſay, <q>We will have no Battel with our Enemy as yet: The Leader, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Action are our Life or Death, will ſhortly be Stone-blind, and under the Dead Palſie. And we will ſtay till he be ſo, before we employ him.</q> O plotted Self-Deſtruction! O Choſen Ruine! If this Conſideration go for nothing with you, ye are Blind againſt Sun-ſhine, and Deaf unto Thunder.</p>
            <p>C. 4. <hi>Your Bodies, the Inſtruments of your Souls Action, be not yet ſo ſorry as Old Peoples be; and as yours will be moſt certainly, if you Convert not preſently.</hi> Sirs, An Unſanctified Body is a Souls Unknown Enemy.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Trojan Horſe,</hi> a <hi>Pandora</hi>'s <hi>Box,</hi> a Forge of Miſchiefs. Your Young ones are ſuch, that (almoſt proverbially) the Blood of Youth is <hi>Satan's Tinder and Match.</hi> 'Tis ſeen, you have warm Boſom for all Snakes. <hi>Legions of Devils are a leſs formidable Army, than your own five Senſes unhallowed.</hi> Beware of the Fleſh. But withal, know ye, an Unruly Horſe is more deſirable than a Dead one: He may be Bridled, and made ſerviceable. 'Tis better with you, than Old Folk; if you will but well uſe, that whereof they want the uſe. <hi>Health,</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> in general; reading <hi>Eyes,</hi> and hearing <hi>Ears,</hi> and walking <hi>Feet</hi> in particular. Old Age is it ſelf, ſay ſome, a Diſeaſe; a very Hoſpital of all. Many, are deprived of the means of Grace by Blindneſs and Deafneſs. Moſt, do uſe them with much pain and great diſadvantage. None have ſo few Clogs about them as you. So that <hi>great is your advantage</hi> for working out your Salvation. Your <hi>Labour is leſs</hi> to read or hear an Hundred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, than theirs to hear or read one. And to go Twenty Miles for Advice, than theirs to go Twenty Steps. Being that Sin, and ſo Death, came in at the Eye and Ear; and it is God's Will to drive them out at the ſame; and to tranſmit the Wiſdom that ſaves our Souls, through thoſe Bodily Senſes; theſe are not inconſiderable things.</p>
            <p>O that you had heard, but what I have done, of poor Old Creatures Outcryes! Curſing the Courſes and Companies that devoured their ſtrength. Wailing with ſighs and tears, their diſability to Read; diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:40119:204"/> of hearing; and utterly loſt faculty of Remembring. The <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> ought to cut my Heart; may the <hi>Notice</hi> ſway yours! If you will yet put off your Converſion, this is the Language which that Delay utters; <q>I have a work given me to do that is for my Life Eternal. I have yet Eyes, and Ears, and Hands and Feet. I have Eaſe, and Strength. But theſe all have Wings, and will ſhortly fly and be gone as others be. When gone, I cannot work, or, if I do, it muſt be in the Fire as it were. Nevertheleſs, I will not ſet to my Work till my Sun and Moon and Stars be darkned. I will not ſtir one Foot for Heaven, till my other Foot is in the Grave. If my Peace be ever made with God, it ſhall be even at the Graves brink. When I am juſt come to the Mouth of Hell, and can ſcarce open my own Mouth to deprecate it, I will beſtow a wiſh for Heaven, if that may poſſeſs me of it.</q> Senſleſs Creature, that wanteſt nothing of a Bruit, but Hair, and two Feet more!</p>
            <p>C. 5. <hi>The World, another back friend of yours, hath not yet lain ſo many Loads on your backs, as upon Old Peoples; and as it will lay on yours, if you live longer, and live under its Power and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſubjected and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconvert unto God.</hi> This I ſpeak to you eſpecially of the Younger ſort, Children, and next to Children. I hope you have heard what an Enemy the World and the things of it do make, to Converſion and Sanctification. Read the <hi>Texts in the Margent.</hi> Read <hi>Eccleſiaſtes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Jo. 2.15, 16. Jam. 4.4. Matth. 6.24.</note> a whole Book of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture took up in warning us againſt this ſaid Enemy. More or leſs Woe is to every Dweller in it, becauſe of the <hi>Avocations,</hi> the <hi>Diſtractions</hi> and <hi>Interruptions</hi> of this Old <hi>Adam</hi>'s World. But here alſo you have the better, ordinarily of Old People. For themſelves, or (their more Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Selfs,) their Children, they are ſwallowed up of <hi>Deſigns, Bargains,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gains</hi> and <hi>Loſſes</hi> make their Souls a Sea of tempeſtuous Cares, knowing little calm or quietneſs. You are yet free, comparatively; and Unladen. You may <hi>Contemplate</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> for next World, without the weights of this depreſſing you. And go to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without <hi>Farms,</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> haling you back. Haling you, as they do hale away multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes before your Eyes; and as they will ere long be haling your ſelves.</p>
            <p>If now <hi>ye will not come unto him, that ye may have Life;</hi> if you will not now begin running your Race toward the Redeemer, what do you do? Truly juſt as a Man, that is to run for his Life; but cannot be perſwaded to ſtir a foot, till he has gotten many more Sheets of Lead upon his back, and many more Fetters upon his feet. Riſe Sinner, riſe? If not, theſe Words ſhall be thy Souls Eternal Loads.</p>
            <p>R. 6. <hi>The Providence of God lendeth you more Phyſicians and kinder ones, than it doth lend Old Diſeaſed Sinners; and then it will lend you, if you live much longer. Eſpecially, if you live <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconvert.</hi> True it is, Gods Love and Mercy unto all, is wonderful. God ſends abundance of Helpers unto all poor ſinful Creatures. Every Baptized Profeſſor, is obliged to be his <hi>Brothers Keeper.</hi> All Believers, are bound to be <hi>Charitative Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> unto each other, Miniſters of Reproof, Counſel, Comfort. In Chriſt's
<pb facs="tcp:40119:205"/> Body, no Member ſhould be all for himſelf; or for leſs than the good of all. But a double Portion of Spiritual help, is ordinarily vouchſafed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Young People. Of Soul-Phyſicians, you have more than two for Old Peoples one. They have <hi>Miniſters;</hi> ſo have you, or may have if you pleaſe. They have <hi>Religious Friends,</hi> ſo have you I hope. But then you have <hi>Parents</hi> which they have not: You have <hi>Maſters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> which they have not. And be it conſidered, the Aged People have few or none that will deal ſo boldly with them, as almoſt all deal with you. Miniſters and Friends, do moſtly either fear to offend, or deſpair and think impoſſible to benefit old Sinners, with any Counſels. They think it the <hi>ſame thing to give Advice to an Old Body, and Phyſick to a dead one.</hi> And if they give any, 'tis as cold as <hi>Elie</hi>'s rebukes. But both come more couragiouſly upon you. They leſs fear your Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and more hope your Reformation. And therefore with more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and acrimonie deal with you. Beſides, your Parents <hi>Love,</hi> and your Maſters and Tutors <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and the <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> of both, do engage them to follow you cloſe. And to do more than Miniſters and Friends are ordinarily capable of doing, for the Converſion of your Souls. Upon all hands, 'tis beſt with you. You have the help of moſt Phyſicians, in number; and of all the number, you have moſt of their help. Incomparably more than Old Folk have; and then you muſt look to have in your evil days approaching.</p>
            <p>But you will ſtill delay, will you not? I doubt many will. And will, as 'twere in ſo many words, ſhew us this is their mind. <hi>Sick</hi> they think themſelves; <hi>Sinners,</hi> they confeſs it, they are. A ſtore of <hi>Spiritual Phyſicians</hi> now they have, they own it; But of theſe Phyſicians and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, ſome will by and by <hi>die;</hi> others <hi>decay;</hi> and none be ſo helpful here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as now. Nevertheleſs, Live Soul or Dye, they will not till here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after engage in any ſerious care of their Spiritual Cure and Recovery. They will ſtay till they have Helpers <hi>fewer</hi> in Number, more <hi>Chill</hi> in their Affection and Care, and <hi>leſs capable</hi> of taking pains for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Sad Infatuation! A wondrous Will to get out of <hi>Probability,</hi> unto bare <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of Life; if ſo much!</p>
            <p>C. 7. <hi>You have ſpecial Encouragements to Convert now, from all general Obſervation and Experience; ſuch as Old People are paſt, and you will e're long be paſt.</hi> I muſt remember my bounds; and therefore will name but three. One would think they ſhould be enough to move any thing not twice dead. And to pull out your Folly, unleſs it be extraordinarily bound up in you. Young People,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God Regenerates the moſt of his choſen in Early Years.</hi> If that Early Riſers were moſtly the Men that grew Rich, and lived long in the World, who of you would not leave lying late in Bed? Truly, They that riſe in the Morning of their Days, and turn unto God, be moſtly the Men that ever overcome the Devil. They that continue in the Bed of their ſecurity late, are in danger of having their Bed in Hell for ever. <hi>A Young Saint, and an Old Devil, is a Proverb, which was certainly hatched in Hell.</hi> God and Men, break Colts when they are Young.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:40119:205"/>2. <hi>God doth Regenerate moſt eaſily, thoſe Souls whom he turneth early.</hi> Know it, Sirs; Pain is neceſſary, thank Sin for it. Had not Sin entred, never had we known Pain, Grief, Fear, or Shame. But now there is a very natural neceſſity for it. Sin is a painful, grievous, fearful, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing: Nor can I ſee, how the Honour of God's Juſtice could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have excuſed Repentance Spiritually, as well as Naturally, we are born in Sorrow. Both ſorts of Children cry before they laugh. All New Creatures, be firſt Mourners. But, all are not in the ſame degree ſo. Nor are all equally long ſowing in Tears, before they do reap in Joy. Some Sinners are Launced more deeply than others; and God keeps open the Wounds of ſome of his Children longer than others; as he pleaſeth. But ordinarily we ſee <hi>young Timothies</hi> be not ſtruck down like <hi>Sauls:</hi> Or if they be, they be not kept ſo many days in frightful darkneſs.</p>
            <p>And is this a ſmall thing? Think of it, and ſay, <q>If my Body had a Sore, of eaſie and ſpeedy cure if the Chirurgeon were applyed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto; I ſhould not ſuffer a little matter to hold me from him. My Soul, and Body, is all Spiritual Wounds. God alone can heal them. Thoſe he doth heal eaſieſt and ſooneſt they be of firſt Comers, moſt commonly. Tardie and late Comers are healed rarely, and ſo as by Fire when they be. What ſhould ail me? Why ſhould I not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ariſe and go to my Father? Why ſhould I buy dearly God's hardeſt blows.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God doth honour Singularly, and Reward with Grace extraordinary his Early Converts.</hi> If any, they be thoſe that have two Heavens; Great Service, and Sweet Aſſurance on Earth, and greater degrees of Glory alſo than others above. Moſt Divines think ſo. Late Converts too much imitate the <hi>Indians;</hi> that eat the Hony themſelves, and offer but the Wax unto their Deities. They give God but the Bran of their Life when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan has had the Flower, as ſome have expreſt themſelves. None ſo much honour God, and none are ſo honoured by him, as thoſe who give Honour to him, and accept it from him in your early days. Infer you then, my Young Folk?</p>
            <p>You muſt Convert preſently, or delay with Loſs: Even with certain danger of Hell, and certain loſs of much of Heaven. And may I not now ſuppoſe the <hi>Objections of your minds</hi> againſt my Doctrine, in good meaſure removed? O that the <hi>Oppoſitions of your Wills</hi> were but as much overpowred! I conclude that your own Hearts do tell you by this time, (unleſs they be unpenetrable as the <hi>Leviathan</hi>'s Skin,)
<q>
                  <l>Converſion is your Duty and Wiſdom;</l>
                  <l>Converſion this very Minute made, is ſo;</l>
                  <l>Converſion now made, is moſt Eaſie, moſt Hopeful, moſt Honourable;</l>
                  <l>Converſion therefore is, of all People, moſt unexcuſably neglected, and moſt encouragedly attempted by you.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet before I make <hi>Application,</hi> I would prevent or remove a peſtilent <hi>Exception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Too many may be ready to ſay, I talk as if Converſion were a Man's own Work: yea, every Child's it ſelf. And ſo Grace and Glory were ve y
<pb facs="tcp:40119:206"/> cheap things. Not the Peculiarities of the Elect; but every Bodies that will but lift up their hands, and take them!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly deſire to ſpeak agreeably unto the Holy Scripture. Thence I learn Converſion to be both <hi>God's</hi> Work, and <hi>ours,</hi> and our <hi>Childrens</hi> too. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.12. <hi>Thou haſt wrought all our Works.</hi> 'Tis God's Work, and he <hi>promiſes</hi> it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 'Tis ours, and he <hi>commands</hi> it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. 'Tis his, we ſay, as to its <hi>Riſe;</hi> he gives to Will and to Doe: 'Tis <hi>Ours</hi> as to the <hi>Act</hi> it ſelf, we do it; and move, by him moved. The Holy Word, is the Miniſtration of the Holy Spirit. <hi>Goſpel</hi> Light, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed always with ſome Spiritual <hi>Strength,</hi> and Ability to turn toward God. It is true that only ſpecial Light and Strength from the Spirit, avails to through and effectual Converſion. But the leſſer and common, are Talents given to profit with, and may be put to uſe. And when they are ſo, (though God be not bound to give the ſpecial,) yet the goodneſs of his <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> of his Grace make it expectable. Eſpecially conſidered conjunctly with the <hi>general Promiſe</hi> of it unto ſome Seekers. All I add is this: Act you up to the Light and Power you have received, not daring to dream that Converſion is not the Duty of Children becauſe 'tis the Work of God. And let not Satan make you think God a <hi>Tyrant</hi> in's Laws, or a <hi>Niggard</hi> of his Aids; until you have diligently uſed all his Means preſcribed, and implored his Bleſſing requiſite, and failed of his Grace when you have done.</p>
            <p>We are indeed certified from the Divine Oracles that God has his <hi>Segullahs.</hi> His peculiar choſen ones. We aſcribe to himſelf and no other, the Grace that <hi>makes us to differ.</hi> But 'tis alſo made as certain, that God is not wanting to the happineſs of any Souls. Unblemiſhed <hi>goodneſs</hi> governs his abſolute <hi>Soveraigntie</hi> it ſelf. <hi>His Decrees be as firm, as though no man had a Liberty of Will: Yet we are all at our Choice as truly as if there were no fore-determining Decree. Vult Deus nos libere velle.</hi> God ſuffers Men to make a free Choice. And gives all Men that which they do <hi>ſupremely</hi> and <hi>finally</hi> chooſe. He gives not to his Elect either Grace or Glory, without their Knowledge, and againſt their Conſent: And he doth not utterly deſert or deſtroy others, till they <hi>harden their Hearts, and chooſe Darkneſs rather than Life.</hi> Till they <hi>hate their Saviour, and Love Death. Prov.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> The culpable cauſe of Mens Damnation, is certainly ſtark wilful Unconverſion. <hi>The outcryes of every Sinner in Hell, are of his own Will.</hi> I offer Grace and Glory but at Chriſt's own Rates, to my beſt Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>I am bold to call Young People thus to think. How juſtifiable would God be in their Deſtruction, if in their Childhood he had took them up to Heaven, and down to Hell. Had ſhewn them both, and offered them their choice. Adviſing them to chooſe Heaven and Converſion the way to it. Aſſuring them, that Hell and Unconverſion ſhould never be theirs againſt their Wills. And they ſhould never here or hereafter be able to cry out, <q>O Lord, fain would I have Grace, rather than all the World. I cry, pray, wait, do all, and the utmoſt I can, and yet thou wilt not give me my Longing! Grace and Heaven are my Choice, but thou
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:40119:206"/> denyeſt them to me.</q> The Truth is, and one day will appear: God doth all this in effect. In his Word he ſets Heaven and hell before you, ſhews you what they are. Bids you chooſe whether you pleaſe. Adviſes you to chooſe the beſt. Points out the wayes that lead unto both. Aſſures you that the worſt home and way unto it ſhall never be yours againſt your Wills. And if you long for the beſt home and way, you ſhall not looſe your Longing. In a word; aſſures you that his <hi>Arbitrary Will</hi> ſhall never be your Ruine, if your own ſinful <hi>Obſtinate Will</hi> be not. Charging you of all Enemies to beware of <hi>your ſelves,</hi> and of all in your ſelves to beware of <hi>your Wills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe your Wills are inacceſſable and unmoveable, but through your Minds. Unto which I therefore proceed to commend ſome of the Truths, which reſult from our preceding Diſcourſe. Young People, you are thoſe to whom I continue ſpeaking; and whoſe regards I call for unto theſe <hi>Ten Inferences.</hi> Even preſent regards, now while Time has Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and you have Ability. <hi>Delay never knew Weal; and haſt unto God never knew Woe.</hi> Never did the Youngeſt Saint lament his being one ſo ſoon. But every true Convert, all his dayes lamenteth his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo late. And, <hi>if they have any trouble in Heaven, 'tis this, that they did not come ſooner into the way of Heaven.</hi> If nothing can make you know what Delays Poyſon is, but the Draughts of it; and what the Swords be, but the Stabs of them; you muſt take your way, and God will take his. And, <hi>Miniſters and Parents muſt be for God's Glory in your Damnation, if you will not be for it in your Converſion.</hi> But come, I have an Hope, and very Confidence I ſhall prevail with ſome of you. Yea, all: Save ſuch as ſay in their hearts, <hi>God is not; God cares not; God cannot deſtroy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverts.</hi> Yea, and I would hope to prevail with ſuch too, if I could make them but <hi>look upon the Frame of the World, look into the Holy Bible, and look what's become of the moſt daring Atheiſts of former Ages.</hi> This would looſen the Cords of Death and Hell; and make even ſuch Spirits leſs furious downward, and more tractable upward. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I declare it, I caſt the Net, in a ſweet hope of a good Draught. I do not believe my Prayers and Pains will be all loſt this time. Some of you will ſo ſuck the Pipes, of Knowledge now, that they will draw the Breaſts of Mercy for ever. Some will drink in theſe following Truths, and drink therein their Souls Everlaſting Health.</p>
            <p>Inference 1. <hi>Your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconvert State is a miſerable One.</hi> 'Tis not requiſite to ones being a <hi>Miſerable</hi> Creature, that one ſhould be an <hi>Old</hi> one. Young ones that Forget, or Unconverſively remember God, are truly miſerable as the Devil: Yea, and are much liker to the Devil, than wicked Old People. For Satan is not a cold, dull, feeble, decrepit, unactive Enemy of God. No, he is as Youthful Sinners be, ſpriteful, quick, ſtrong, full of activity, and unwearied: <hi>A Young Sinner is the Devils moſt lively Picture.</hi> You ſee in my Text, your State is one that God judges an ill one, and calls you out of it, and charges you to make all poſſible ſpeed out of. Many wiſh themſelves in a State of God's Wrath, when they ſay, Oh that I were in but ſo good a Condition as this or that Child!
<pb facs="tcp:40119:207"/> They know leſs than many Catechiſed little Children, who know not this: <hi>Such is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconvert State, that Chriſt himſelf cannot ſave a Soul in it.</hi> The Lord maketh you all to <hi>feel,</hi> the words that I can make you but <hi>hear.</hi> My Father in all his Letters to me uſed to write, O Child, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never born, than not New Born.</p>
            <p>Infer. 2. <hi>Your Miſerable State, is one Alterable.</hi> Would God call you out of your damning forgetfulneſs, if there were no return poſſible? Would he call you to a ſaving Remembrance, if there were a fixed gulf, and unpaſſable between you and Bleſſedneſs? <hi>'Tis ſin and madneſs for the worſt of Sinners to ſay they are Reprobates.</hi> No Man alive can know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſo. And the worſt Man Living muſt make himſelf ſtill worſer, by concluding ſo. Young People, your Unconverſion hitherto, has kept you unreconciled to God but hitherto. You are not now <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreconcileable,</hi> if now ye be not Obſtinate and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nperſwadable.</hi> I praiſe him, who when Satan tempted him to deſpair of Salvation, thus anſwered: <hi>For ſhame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ſay not there's no hope of me; thou mighteſt be ſaved thy ſelf if thou could'ſt Repent!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Infer. 3. <hi>God is willing your miſerable State ſhould be altered, and that ſpeedily too.</hi> Would he otherwiſe call you, and ſo call you, as you have heard? Or, can you tell what ſhould make him unwilling? True, he needs you not: But you need him, and he delights in Mercy, if you will believe him. Forget not this, of God and his Son. <hi>God ſwears by his Life, he deſires not a Sinners Death.</hi> Conſequently, he muſt deſire their Converſion. And as for his Son, your Bleſſed Redeemer; as he ſhed his Blood to ſave Sinners, ſo he ſheds Tears over them when they refuſe his Salvation. 'Tis Satan, not God, that is the <hi>Herod</hi> deſirous to ſlay you, Children! And be confident of this; if he now moves you to Duty, he ſurely means you Mercy.</p>
            <p>Infer. 4. <hi>You your ſelves can do more towards your Converſion, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Alteration, than all the World can do.</hi> This is hence gathered; from God's ſetting his Miniſters, and your Parents, and Friends all, upon your ſelves. He bids us not go to any others, and tell them they muſt go new form your hearts. No, but charges us to apply unto you, and call on you to <hi>make you new Hearts,</hi> and <hi>new Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Convert</hi> unto him, and <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him</hi> to right purpoſe. 'Tis therefore certainly moſt in the power of your own hand, next to Gods. <hi>God has committed you more to your own keeping, than unto any meer Creatures.</hi> And given you more power over your ſelves, than any other Creature hath. Wherefore, neither can beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels benefit you, or worſt Devils injure you, as you can benefit or injure your ſelves. And it leſs concerns you dayly to enquire, what all the World has done for you, or againſt you: Then what you your ſelves have done for or againſt your ſelves. Would you know what is the juſt extent of this Power; what it is you can do, and what it is you cannot do toward your Converſion? Others have anſwered more largely; I ſay this briefly, <hi>Try and you ſhall know. Do all the good you can, and you ſhall know what good you can do.</hi> To lie idle, and do nothing, becauſe you know not how much you can do, were a folly, like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Infant wallowing in its own Blood.</p>
            <pb n="423" facs="tcp:40119:207"/>
            <p>Infer. 5. <hi>Your Tempters from preſent Converſion, are Hells black Legion.</hi> I infer it thus. It is only <hi>Hell</hi> that oppoſeth <hi>Heaven.</hi> Divels, that fight againſt the Command of God. <hi>Black Devils,</hi> that withſtand his <hi>expreſs Commands.</hi> But 'tis his Command, and moſt expreſs one, that you now preſently do Convert. Wherefore as oft as any man diſſwades you from it, tell him, you find by his Lip, he has a <hi>Cloven Foot.</hi> And you ſee Satan is grown idle and impudent, and leaves off the trouble of <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf into an Angel of Light!</hi> Tempting Company, is the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mouth of Hell in all this World!</p>
            <p>Infer. 6. <hi>Your way unto Salvation, is one and the ſelf-ſame with other folks.</hi> If not, why ſhould it be preſcribed in the ſelf-ſame words, that the way of all others is preſcribed in. Sc. <hi>Remembering God. Deut.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.50. There be many <hi>about you,</hi> that will ſhew you young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a ſhorter cut to Heaven. And there is much <hi>within you,</hi> that will catch at it greedily enough. But the Lord give you to receive your ſight; you will then as eaſily believe there is one God for you, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for old people, as that there is one Religion for you, and another for them. Verily there is but one <hi>narrow Gate</hi> for the Entrance, and one <hi>ſtrait Way</hi> for the Progreſs of both of you. Bleſſed are both that find it, Miſerable both that miſs it! I know not how he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, that prompts young people that they may be ſo, without Underſtanding, Owning, and Living ſincerely according unto their Baptiſmal Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! May the weight of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. never lye upon my Soul dear unto me?</p>
            <p>Infer. 7. <hi>Your greateſt Danger, is of delaying to Convert.</hi> Why elſe, are you twice warned thereof in the Text? Why required to Convert <hi>in your Youth</hi> before you are Old? and <hi>juſt Now,</hi> before you are a minute Older. Death ſtands before Old Mens Faces; and one would think they ſhould not venture to put it off. It is ſomewhat farther out of your ſight indeed; but ſo ſwiftly it oft comes, that it is of wonder you your ſelves ſhould be ſo daring as to do it. But, alas, both of you are daily ſeen full of your Delays. Full often in my Pulpit I think, <hi>what a number ſhould I Convert this time, but that my old Folk think they may as well Convert next Week; and my young ones think they may Convert next Year; both think they may Convert another time.</hi> And what ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s my trembling Heart? Plainly thus, <q>Oh Delay, Delay! thou bond of Iniquity, thou bane of Piety, thou bar of Converſion, Satan's great Barge into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, be gone and deſtroy not this Congregation!</q> Sirs, Remember it; <hi>down-right denyal</hi> of Converſion, is nothing near ſo like to ruine you, as <hi>dallying Delay</hi> of it. 'Tis Delay, is the Element of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracy, as Unregeneracy is the Element of Hell.</p>
            <p>Infer. 8. <hi>Youthful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconverts are the worſt of Demoniacks, and break moſt bonds of God.</hi> For, as you have heard, you have ſpecial Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on you. Though God makes your days choice and good, yet cleave you will unto the worſt evil. Though you have on you, the Reſtraints which old ſinners have long ago had took off from them, you ſin as they. The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> that has done ſtriving with many of them, ſtrives ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:40119:208"/> with you. <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that is feared in them, is yet of ſome ſenſe in you. <hi>Parents</hi> and other Reprovers that have done long ago with them, are ſtill plying you. And yet, as they, you ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from us, we deſire no Communion with thee.</hi> With more violence than they, you take the Kingdom of Hell by force? The path to Hell, is harder unto your Feet than theirs.</p>
            <p>Infer. 9. <hi>It is your Duty to ſhame your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconvert Fathers and Mothers.</hi> For, obſerve you; you ſhame them, if you remember, and they forget God. If you come to Chriſt, and they either come not, or come behind after you. <hi>God, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> will pronounce you <hi>Wiſe</hi> and them <hi>Fools.</hi> But what then? Would God have you ſtay for them, and not Convert until they do? By no means. He commands you to Convert juſt now; and conſequently to ſhame them; if they have not, and do not. By ſo ſhaming them, <hi>ſome Children have been the bleſſed Inſtruments of Converting their Parents.</hi> Of Spiritually Begetting their Natural Fathers. The only way this ſeems, wherein a Child can requite a Parent. For if a Beggers Child win a Kingdom and give it his Father, his debt to him is too big to be ſo paid: But if he Converts him, he pays him in broad Gold, methinks. Parents, think ye of this. And Children, this know ye; 'tis therefore I do not caution you againſt all ſinful ways of ſhaming your Parents, becauſe well I know, <hi>Becoming dutiful to God, you cannot but honour and love your Parents next unto God himſelf.</hi> That which I ſee of many Parents in City and Countrey hath extorted this Inference from me.</p>
            <p>Infer. 10. <hi>Your Preſent dayes are your precious and beſt.</hi> So the Word in the Text, and words following ſpeak plainly. Sirs, your young Dayes, be but <hi>Dayes;</hi> and of <hi>Short</hi> Continuance, yea and <hi>dubious.</hi> Some are Old, as we ſpeak, ſooner then others. Their <hi>Flowers</hi> ſooner fade, and their <hi>Graſs</hi> more quickly withers. But when ever your <hi>Evening</hi> falls, you ſhall wiſh it again <hi>Morning</hi> with you. If nothing elſe will do it, <hi>Old Age will convince you of the Excellence of Youth.</hi> It was wittily, that by ſome Time was thus pictured of old: <hi>Time to come,</hi> had the head of a <hi>fawning Dog; Time preſent,</hi> the head of a <hi>ſtirring Lion; Time paſt,</hi> the head of a <hi>biting Wolf.</hi> So teaching, that though ſilly Souls fancy ſtill that their beſt days are <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A thouſand Worlds I would give for a few of your learning, getting dayes again. Of all things prize your time, and of all time your young, which is your Sowing-time.</q> 'Tis upon <hi>Eternities</hi> account, that any thing can be judged <hi>Excellent.</hi> Nor doth ought make for our bleſſed Eternity, but vital Piety. And ſurely, for that, there is no ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon like to Lifes Morning. <hi>Poets</hi> ſay, 'tis a friend to the Muſes; <hi>Divines</hi> muſt proclaim it the Friend of Graces.</p>
            <pb n="424" facs="tcp:40119:208"/>
            <p>For why? as incongruous as Atheiſtic Vermin do conceit Youth and Religion, 'tis plain as Noon-day Light, that <hi>Religion is ſpecially framed for Youth, and Youth for Religion.</hi> Let Shame be their Portion who are ready to drop the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb upon every Religious young head; <hi>Tanto buon — This Puritan Youth is ſo good, that he is good for nothing.</hi> Young people remember the ſeven Stars in your Firmament; and tell me how fit they are for Religion, and Religion for them?</p>

               <hi>Tenacious and Prompt Memory.</hi> What is this Treaſury for, but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? and how Poor muſt Religion live (if Live) without it. Age will dry your Brains, and make Sieves of your Memories.</p>

               <hi>Flexibleneſs and Self-denial.</hi> VVhat are theſe Spiritual Joints for, but Religious bowings? And how little can the moſt profoundly Religious Soul ſtoop to its Maker without them? Old Age, has ſtiff joints, of Soul as well as Body.</p>

Sirs, in a word; The Truth I beg deepeſt engravement of upon your Hearts, is this of the Matchleſs Excellence of your preſent days. Verily, ſo fit is Youth, the beſt of Life, for Religion, the beſt of Employment; and ſo Uſeleſs, yea Harmful, are the endowments of Youth, without Religion; and ſo poor and unlovely an aſpect has Religion without the uſe of Youths Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that it is a pity but Youth and Religion ſhould Marry, and Unite.

            <p>Direction 1. <hi>Chuſe each of you a Spiritual Guide in the affairs of your Souls.</hi> There are Men ordained by God to be <hi>Eyes unto the Blind,</hi> and <hi>Feet to the Lame,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> to all that would be Gods Children. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe not Eyes and Feet for your Souls; nor live you Orphans, when you may have Fathers. Go unto ſome one or another of them; tell him, you hear that Chriſt's Miniſters are his Repreſentatives. And, that Chriſt's Word without his appointed Miniſtry of it, may not be expected to cleanſe a Young Mans way; nor any others. Get a Promiſe from him, to lend you his beſt Direction to thorough Converſion. A Youth without a Paſtor, is a Child without a Nurſe.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe him whom you chuſe your Guide for your Soul; and follow him as far as he follows Jeſus Chriſt.

               <hi>Holy Faith!</hi> Is a Grace moſt Precious; by God moſt highly honoured; and, of all, moſt honouring God; Honouring him in ſome reſpects, more than <hi>Adam</hi>'s perſonal Obedience did before the Fall.

The <hi>Exertion of humble Care</hi> in heart-ſearches doth anſwer many Goſpel-precepts. And when it is <hi>much and often,</hi> it is not the leaſt Evidence of trueſt grace. For Bankrupts can no more endure much looking into their Count-books, than ſore Eyes can bear long beholding of Sun-ſhine. And as impatient be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites of very much conning the Scriptures, and their Hearts!</p>
            <p>But I conclude. Young people; <hi>Mahomet</hi> gat the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, by making extraordinary haſt. And <hi>Alexander</hi> Conquered the World, by the ſame Policy; <hi>Never Delaying.</hi> Go you and out-do them: <hi>Conquer</hi> VVorld, Fleſh, and Devil; And <hi>take by violence</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven; by your haſting to Remember, and Convert juſt now. VVith great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our Law makes it Death to conceal High Treaſon, ſo much as four and twenty hours. I am ſure God's Law requires you to Confeſs and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your higher Treaſon againſt Chriſts Crown, without ſo much as a Minutes delay. And with much more Reaſon and Equity.</p>
            <p>I thought I had done. But I am ſenſible how little I have done. And therefore before I make an end, I muſt try to ſet two ſorts of People a doing more for poor Unconvert young ones. Two very concerned ones in the caſe. Two, that my Text hath ſurely ſomewhat to do with. I mean <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Surely Natural and Eccleſiaſtical Fathers are all bound to joyn me in preaching of this portion of Scripture.</p>
            <p>To you <hi>Natural Parents,</hi> I firſt Addreſs. Beſeeching you, that <hi>you go ſtudy what you have to do, and do all that you ſhall know, for your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens early Converſion.</hi> I am of the mind, that <hi>gallant Language ne're did Gods Work.</hi> And do find it what you call <hi>Wild Note,</hi> rather than <hi>ſet Muſick,</hi> that I can ever move you by. VVherefore plainly I tell you, we may thank you for Earth's becoming thus unlike Heaven, and like to Hell. VVe may thank your Negligence, and worſe, for the ruin of more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than ever <hi>Herod</hi> ſlew; or the <hi>Lyar and Murderer of France</hi> himſelf. VVe may thank you, that Children be ſo generally <hi>Beaſts</hi> before they are <hi>Young Men;</hi> and <hi>young Devils</hi> before they are <hi>Old Men.</hi> VVe may thank you for vitiating the moſt <hi>numerous,</hi> the moſt <hi>ductile,</hi> and the moſt <hi>hopeful</hi> part of the VVorld. For robbing God of his <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> in the VVorld.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you by Gods tender Mercies, <hi>repent</hi> of your Cruelties. And I charge you before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>reform</hi> ye ſtraitway; and do as aforeſaid. The <hi>Light of Nature</hi> that guides you to help your Children to go, and to ſpeak, and to do what is neceſſary for this Life; guides you alſo to help them for the Divine Life. Nor can you doubt but <hi>Gods Ordinance</hi> in the old Church for the appearanee of the Male-children
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:40119:210"/> before him thrice in the Year, was to bring them to an early Acquaintance with himſelf. And, there is ſtill both need and obligation to keep the ſubſtance of that precept now under the Goſpel. O let it not be ſaid any longer, that your care is more for your Childrens <hi>Cloaths,</hi> than their <hi>Souls.</hi> For ſhame, Sirs, for ſhame, let them not be wicked without your pity, nor Converted without your pains! Think ye daily of both the <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> and <hi>Engagements</hi> to do it.</p>

               <hi>Your Advantages.</hi> You do Love your Children beſt; do you not: And you are beſt Beloved by them. You are Neareſt unto them; and have moſt Authority over them. You do know their Capacities, and their Tempers. VVho can ſuit them as you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Engagements.</hi> Their ſore Needs do engage you. And ſo do the ſore Evils that (however undeſignedly) you have done them. Who brought <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin upon them and into them, but you? And who dares ſay, that your own <hi>perſonal Sins</hi> have done them no wrong?</p>
            <p>Dying Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had made his Peace with God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> told me, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize ſome of his Pariſhioners Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he ſaw, they would not afterward breed them up to Chriſtianity.</note> And told his Children, <hi>that his Sins ſhould not hurt them therefore, unleſs they made them their own.</hi> Can you ſay ſo, if you were now to dye? Well; very Nature alſo engages you. Ay, and Equity binds you. For your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are God's, more than yours; and ſure it is to him, and for him, that you ſhould educate his Children. Truth alſo engages you. For you promiſed you would ſo educate them, when you had them Baptized; did you not?</p>
            <p>The Fear and Love of God, if any be in you, do engage you. And ſo doth your own Intereſt alſo. Yea laſtly, Shame engages you. For 'tis a ſhame, is it not? To teach Children to honour and ſerve you, and not to honour and ſerve their God and yours. I have bid many Children ask you, whether if they were too young to be bound to keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they were not alſo too young to be bound to keep yours? Liſten not to the White Devils that will ſuggeſt. If your Children take not to Religion of themſelves without your ado, your pains will do but little good. Do Horſes or Camels tame themſelves? Do Men tame Beaſts of the Wilderneſs, and you not tame the Children of your own Bodies and Families? But all in a Word? Does God ſet you a work, and promiſe you Succeſs, and you dream it to no purpoſe to ſet about it? Read you <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.13, 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.17, <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>As for you, <hi>Church-Fathers,</hi> may I humbly aſſume to ſtir up your Minds but in way of Remembrance? You know, if the <hi>Lambs</hi> be loſt, the Lord of the Flock will with great anger ask, <hi>Where were the Shepherds all the while? What were they doing?</hi> Nor will our higheſt feeding of the <hi>Sheep,</hi> compound for the loſs of his <hi>Lambs.</hi> And I doubt it will not ſuffice to ſay, <q>Lord, we were the while digging for profound <hi>Notions,</hi> or Diſputing Nice <hi>Questions,</hi> or ſtudying polite <hi>Sermons;</hi> for people, whoſe Peace and whoſe Praiſe we could not have cheaper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Brethren, for the Lords Sake let us all do ſomewhat <hi>weekly,</hi> and ſet the Parents of our Congregations doing ſomewhat <hi>daily,</hi> for young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Souls. And let both ſet to it <hi>Hopefully,</hi> for the Reaſons foreſaid.

And in <hi>Preaching,</hi> let none of us make need where we find none, to <hi>ſhoot over young folks heads;</hi> and uſe a Language, we muſt needs know they underſtand not. Love of God and of them would make us willing, rather to be trampled under Scorners feet for our Faithfulneſs, then to ride over their heads in Figures of Vain-glorious impertinence. The which, wiſe Hearers do no more commend, than weak Hearers do Underſtand. Neither be it any more grievous to us than it was to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to have now and then an <hi>Ad vos Juvenes.</hi> To call and tell them, Young people this is for you! <hi>I would be glad to ſee wanton Wits have leſs Sawce, and weak Souls have more Meat in all our Sermons.</hi> And to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that our pains in making <hi>Converts,</hi> did exceed the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in making <hi>Proſelytes?</hi> For it muſt be owned; <hi>'tis an uncolourable Profaneneſs, to Baptize Infancy, and not teach Youth; or but ſlightly.</hi> Becauſe otherwiſe, we ſhall ſtarve the <hi>Nurſery;</hi> and then what becomes of Jeſus Chriſt's <hi>Family?</hi>

            <p>The good Lord awaken us all! And ſet <hi>Miniſters, Parents, Young people themſelves,</hi> all, a doing, and well doing.

            <p>THE Prophet joyneth Counſel with Threatnings; Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that he calleth them to, as a means to ſave them. That he might induce them to this, he repreſents their ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated Sins, and the dangers to which they were expoſed by their Provocations: Yet leaſt this Call ſhould ſtill be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual through an opinion, that Repentance could avail little to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo guilty; he addeth, that if they returned to God, their Sins, tho' great, ſhould not prevent Mercy; and the threatned Judgments, though near, might be diverted.</p>
            <p>By this Text God proclaims, not only to particular Perſons, but to Nations, how deſireable it is to him to execute his Goodneſs, and his extream backwardneſs to avenge himſelf on the moſt provoking King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; unleſs they add Impenitency under ſolemn Warnings unto their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>God ſeems to addreſs himſelf to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to this purpoſe; Thou are a very guilty People, yet turn, that I may forgive. Thou art on the very brink of ruine; thy obſtinateneſs is ſo notorious, that it will not conſiſt with the Rules or Credit of my Government, to ſpare thee longer. Oh yet be perſwaded to render thy ſelf a Subject capable of my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I have long pleaded, and thou ſeemeſt even unperſwadable: Yet I'll make one further eſſay; I'll try thee once more. <hi>Sow to your ſelves in Righteouſneſs.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:40119:212"/> in the deſcription of this Duty: <hi>q. d.</hi> 1. He that will repent muſt deal with his indiſpoſed Heart: <hi>Break up the fallow ground;</hi> whatever pain or difficulty attends ſo barren, or obſtinate a frame of Soul, you muſt ſtrive with your ſelves; pluck up thoſe Weeds, ſtrike at the root of your Luſts, which render the Fruits of Righteouſneſs impoſſible. This ſence of that clauſe is more evident from thoſe words of another Prophet; <hi>Break up the fallow ground;</hi>

               <hi>Reap in Mercy.</hi> It's promiſed more ſtrongly, then if it had been ſaid Indicatively; you ſhall <hi>reap</hi> in the Future Tenſe. Being put thus Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, the import of it is this, you have no more to do, but poſſeſs your Mercies upon your Repentance: Mercy will of it ſelf grow from that Root. God hath provided all antecedent Cauſes; he hath ordained the connexion; and it lies on him to make a Repenting People happy. You may be aſſured of this; for that which was meer Mercy in making the Promiſe, is become an Act of Righteouſneſs by the Promiſe. You may now expect it from God as juſt; in which ſenſe I take that clauſe, <hi>till he come, and rain Righteouſneſs upon you.</hi> That which was Mercy in the firſt part of the Verſe, is Righteouſneſs in the laſt part. I know it's true Doctrine to ſay, till God beſtow on you holy inclinations, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to perform; but that's not the moſt deſigned Senſe.

            <p>There's one Motive more, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſeaſonableneſs. <hi>It's time to ſeek the Lord.</hi> It's high time, and but barely ſo; you cannot ſay there is no hope; though you muſt repent ſoon or not at all. The conſideration of this Paraphraſe muſt lead any one to the caſe that I am to handle: Can any ſerious Spirit think it vain to ask? What is that National Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which may give a ſinful people hope of Mercy? Which is the ſame with the Caſe as it is given me.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Evidence that the Repentance expreſſed in the fifth head, doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily afford ground of our expectation of National Mercies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding National Sins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That when this Repentance is not in a Nation, we cannot ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily expect National Mercies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Theſe things are ſuppoſed in the Caſe as ſtated. Where there is Sin, there ought to be Repentance. There are National ſins as well as Perſonal ſins, that a Nation as ſuch, becomes guilty by National ſins. There are Mercies which attend a people as a Community. Our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Sins have removed National Mercies, or at leaſt prevent and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the beſtowing of theſe Mercies. God requires a Repentance for National Sins, and that as a means of National Mercies. There may be a Repentance which may be defective to this end, and from which we cannot groundedly expect ſuch Mercies. That there is a Repentance for National Sins, which if we arrive at, may warrant our expectation of National Mercies. Theſe and ſuch like are ſuppoſed as the Caſe is ſtated, and therefore I paſs them by.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall enquire what National Sins are, and what National Mercies are: The reſt of the terms in the Caſe will be handled under other heads.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What are National Sins in the Queſtion?</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:40119:213"/>
            <p>The Anſwer directs us to conſider theſe ſeveral parts of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Theſe ſins are groſs in their nature: They are not ſins of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,<note place="margin">Ezek. 7.23.</note> or ſins which ordinary care, labour and watchfulneſs, could not prevent. They are called <hi>bloody crimes.</hi> You may find them ennume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, when God arraigns Nations in the Teſtimony of his Prophets, when calling them to Repentance; and when God juſtifieth the ſeverity of his Judgments againſt a People. I ſhall name ſome of them which defile a Land:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 10.4. Jer. 23.10. Pſal. 78.50. Iſa. 3.15. Ez. 21.23, 24. Iſa. 1.21, 23. Luke 10.10.11, 13. 1 Theſſ. 2.16. Rev. 2.3. Hoſ. 11.7. Iſa. 59.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 35.15. Amos 8.9.</note> Idolatry, Perjury, Breaking of Covenant, Blood, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Apoſtacy, Oppreſſion, Profaneneſs; I need not bring Proof hereof, the Scriptures are full. Yea, among ſuch provocations are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned Mens refuſal of the Goſpel, ſilencing and obſtructing the Miniſtry, malignity againſt good Men, Diviſions and Enmity, Lying, Pride, abuſe of Mercies, groſs Formality, Hypocriſie, great Decays among Saints, and groſs Backſlidings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe ſins muſt be National, ſuch as denominate a Kingdom ſinful. We conſider them not as the ſins of particular Perſons, but as they affect a Community, as United among themſelves, and diſtinguiſhed from others, by ſome ſpecial Bonds.</p>
            <p>We will enquire for the clearing of this,</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How Sins become National?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By all, or the generality of a People, being perſonally Tranſgreſſors, as to thoſe Crimes: <hi>The whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>from the ſole of the foot, to the crown of the head, there is no ſoundneſs.</hi> Thus <hi>Sodom</hi> could not afford Ten innocent perſons. The Infection is oft propagated to the whole Body, though begun in a few; as,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.15.</note> 
               <hi>from the Prophets of Jeruſalem, is profaneneſs gone forth into all the Land:</hi> This doth not mean, that every individual is corrupted, but the generality of all ſorts:<note place="margin">Jer. 32.32. Mal. 3.9.</note> Magiſtrates, Prieſts and People were profane; <hi>Ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Governours, Repreſentatives, and influencing Perſons, are Tranſgreſſors:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.15.</note> 
               <hi>I will love them no more, all their Princes are revolters. Iſrael</hi> is become vile by the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> wrath againſt <hi>Judah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 23.26.</note> becauſe <hi>of the provocations that Manaſſah had provoked God withall.</hi> Provoking abominations by the Rulers of a People, and curſed Laws,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.1.</note> defile a Land and expoſe it. <hi>Saul</hi> brings a Famine on <hi>Iſrael</hi> by violating the Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> What Governours do may be ſaid to be done by a Nation: Though I think, when Judgments take their expreſs riſe from the ſins of Rulers, there is ſome other guilt among the People,<note place="margin">Hab. 3.8.</note> ripening them for Judgment, or a complyance with their Rulers ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the generality of a Nation making it ſelf partaker of other Mens ſins though it do not actually commit them. Some that do not perſonally commit the ſins,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.13. Zeph. 3.13. Iſa. 22.12. Hoſ. 7.5.</note> may become guilty of them, by not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſins according to their power; by rejoycing in thoſe iniquities or Pleading for them; by not mourning for them; by contributing to thoſe Enormities. Theſe wayes a Land may be guilty, though a few Chief Men act the ſin.</p>
            <pb n="429" facs="tcp:40119:213"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Theſe ſins are ſuch as expoſe to Judgments, and forfeit Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Mercies: Theſe are here intended, and reference to both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heads muſt be had; but beſides the groſneſs of the ſins as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, and their extent as National; on both which accounts they become National Provocations.</p>
            <p>The Caſe requires our obſerving further.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That more refined Sins may expoſe one Nation to Judgments, which may not expoſe another Land. This depends on the variety of advantages ſome people are under above others. A Nation that hath Goſpel helps, and profeſſeth Holineſs, and Worſhipeth the true God, may be expoſed to Judgments by Formality, Backſliding, and more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Evils than other Lands not ſo circumſtantiated. Sins below groſs Immoralities may as truly forfeit their Mercies, as Injuſtice, Blood, or Idolatry, amongſt ignorant Paganiſh Countries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The provoking Sins of one and the ſame Nation may be made up by various kinds of offences, according to the different condition of the offenders.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a Land is polluted by the ſame ſort of Sins propogated through the Body of the People.</p>
            <p>But it is not always ſo, the offences vary, and the National Guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the ſeveral offences.</p>
            <p>The ſins of Magiſtrates are of one kind, and the ſins of the Subjects another, according to their different Talents and Station.</p>
            <p>The Profane part of a Nation tranſgreſs by enormous Crimes, and the Profeſſing part are polluted with more Spiritual wickedneſs, as Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, Deadneſs, Cenſoriouſneſs.<note place="margin">Am. 64.6. Jer. 23.11. Iſa. 56.10, 11. Jer. 28. &amp; 5.31. Mic. 6.11, 12. Mi. 7.4, 6.</note> The offences of the Gentry and Commonalty may be ſeveral. Miniſters and People may fill up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of iniquity in a different manner.</p>
            <p>Hence you ſee, that a Nation may be guilty, though ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Villany may not be Univerſal: It's enough if the different ſorts of Inhabitants groſly offend in their ſeveral kinds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Uſually the ſins of a Nation do not bring Judgments, or forfeit Mercies, by the ſimple Commiſſion of them; but as attended with ſome additional aggravations.</p>
            <p>A Land rarely is deſtroyed, unleſs ſins are committed after warnings. Utter Deſtruction comes not before leſſer Judgments have been tryed,<note place="margin">Am. 4.</note> and prove unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Security and Impenitency is added to Rebellion before God proceeds againſt a People.</p>
            <p>The Lords Goodneſs diſplays it ſelf in his Calls, and Patience waiteth an Anſwer, ere he takes the advantage againſt a Land.<note place="margin">Iſa. 3.9.</note> Oft beſides the groſneſs of ſins, there is boldneſs and ſhamefulneſs; <hi>they declare their ſin as Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not mention antecedent aggravations, as Light, Convictions, Covenant bonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which add a weight to ſin whiles committing.</p>
            <p>You ſee what National Sins are in the Queſtion, and when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch as hazard the ruine of a People.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:214"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What are National Mercies in the Caſe before us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such Bleſſings as truly and conſiderably affect the good of a Community.</p>
            <p>They muſt be Bleſſings in their nature, and National in their extent; they muſt have an aptitude to the Common Weale, the more they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to make a Land happy, the greater the Mercy is. Neither is the gracious deſign of God to bleſs a Land thereby, to be diſregarded; for ſometimes he rains Snares,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.29, 31.</note> and gives Quails in judgment.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mercies regard our Souls, or our Bodies, or both: I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate ſome of them:<note n="*" place="margin">By pardon I mean an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hments for thoſe ſins.</note> The pardon of paſt ſins, and help againſt the like offences; the pretence of God as effective of Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good; Goſpel Ordinances; a Holy, Judicious, Faithful Miniſtry; a pure Worſhip; the Spirits energie in the Goſpel, to the Converſion of many Sinners, and real Edification of Saints; whereby the eſtate of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be flouriſhing; a Godly Diſcipline, and Communion of Saints founded on plain Goſpel Terms; Love and Peace among Churches, grounded on eſſential not diſputable Notions, and expreſſed in all the fruits of Chriſtian Love; freedom from Perſecution and Malignity; a Godly Magiſtracy, uſing its Power to reſtrain Sin, and promote Godlineſs; Peace in our Borders; Juſtice in our Courts; Learning in the Schools; Wiſdom and ſincere deſigns for publick good among Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours; Plenty, by a Bleſſing on ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Trades and Labours; Health in our Streets; Credit and Influence among Neighbouring Countries; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſuch Judgments as waſte and debate a Land. Theſe and the like, conſtitute a happy Nation: They are Mercies which National Sins forfeit, and without which the aſpect of a Land is mournful. Greater or leſs degrees of all or any of theſe are within the Queſtion, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our expectations, and the ſorts and degrees are oft proportioned to a Nations Repentance, and determined by it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Caſe ſtated and diſtinguiſhed from what ſeems like it: It is not what Repentance God requireth of particular perſons in order to Eternal Life, nor what Repentance God requireth of a ſinful Nation as its duty; nor what's that Repentance without which a Nation ſhall never enjoy National Mercies; nor what Repentance is that on which every Nation, in all caſes, ſhall partake of National Mercies; nor what ſhall limit our Prayers, nor yet altogether our Hopes, as to the ſtate of a Land; much leſs what is that Repentance which will beſt ſecure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Mercies? But the Queſtion connects our Repentance and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able expectations: The ſcope of it is; What is the loweſt ſort or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Repentance for National Sins which is requiſite to warrant, and ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arily direct our expectations of National Mercies?</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why I add ordinarily will appear after; the indefiniteneſs of the term National Mercies, whether of this kind or of that, to this or that degree, I inſiſt not upon. Suppoſing that it imports at leaſt ſo much and many Mercies, as render a Nation tolerably happy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from what it eſteems calamitous.</p>
            <pb n="426" facs="tcp:40119:214"/>
            <p>Fourthly, The Difficulties of the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Its not only hard to determine it, as the <hi>minimum quod ſic</hi> in any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for Mercy, nor yet as a thing depending on Multitudes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Providence of God as to what's future, but there are theſe other things that make it difficult.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Other Nations are not under ſuch expreſs Rules, with reſpect to Gods outward dealings, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation was.</p>
            <p>That people was under a Theocracy, <hi>God was their King;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.12.</note> on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Lord chargeth them, when they were for a King;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.7.</note> that <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me that I ſhould not reign over them.</hi> Idolatry alſo was High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in that State, they were Gods peculiar Nation, and thereby to live in a more immediate dependance on him even in Civil reſpects,<note place="margin">Iſa. 51.4.</note> than other People.</p>
            <p>The Rules of their External Priviledges (both Church and National) were expreſs in that Covenant of peculiarity, whereinto they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. This Covenant eaſily determined mens Expectations of Gods dealings with them. But I think, we cannot always conclude from Gods Methods towards them, how he will deal with other Nations, that are not under the ſame Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There have been alwayes great diſplays of Soveraignty, in Gods Diſpenſation of Judgments, and Mercy, towards Nations. He waites longer on ſome people than on others, though no more guilty. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he granteth favour to a Nation, though its Sins be many; and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth it when its provocations appear leſs.<note place="margin">Joſh. 7.1.</note> The Sins of multitudes are connived at ſometimes, and at other times he afflicteth for the Offences of a few; as in the caſe of <hi>Achan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath diverted Judgments at the Prayer of one <hi>Moſes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo. 32.11, 14. Ez. 14.14. Jer. 7.16.</note> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>though Noah, Daniel, and Job</hi> be there they ſhall deliver no more than themſelves. Yea he hath forbid his Servants to pray for a people, as a thing to no purpoſe. God hath ſorely rebuked ſmall Sins in particular Perſons, as <hi>Moſes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> &amp;c. to let men ſee, its Patience in God, not Innocency in Men, that he ſtill deſtroys not.</p>
            <p>There is exact Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs in all this variety, which the light of a higher State will diſcover; though now by reaſon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his wayes ſeem perplexed to us. However this Soveraign unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableneſs muſt abate our poſitiveneſs in judging, what will be the way of God towards a people; though it hinders not the determining our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Expectations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are prophetick periods wherein National Mercies ſhall not be obſtructed by impenitence, but Repentance ſhall follow them. <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not remarkably penitent, when the time of Redemption from <hi>Egypt</hi> was come; yet God keeps his day.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.62. Hag. 2.14, 16, 17, 18. Rev. 19 1, 7, 8.</note> Their Releaſe from <hi>Babylon</hi> found them in the like unfit poſture, yet God is pacified, and brings them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by their return. <hi>This people is unclean, and what they offer is unclean;</hi> yet he makes them proſper, and build the Temple, even though <hi>they had not turned to him.</hi> And it ſeems to be not much otherwiſe with the Church, when it ſings the Praiſes of God for the conſummating

            <p>When its thus, a bleſſing is withheld from means that tend to make a people penitent; and what of Repentance there is, becomes uneffectual to divert the Miſery. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> repented, <hi>Joſiah</hi> and the People with ſome ſolemnity humble themſelves:<note place="margin">2 King. 23.25, 26, 27.</note> But notwithſtanding this, <hi>the Lord turned not from the fierceneſs of his wrath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>becauſe of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations that Manaſſeh had provoked him withal,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. God ſometimes moderateth and refrains his Judgments, from other Conſiderations beſides Repentance.</p>
            <p>If executing Judgments upon his People, will occaſion Blaſphemy and reproach to his Name; he oft forbeareth his People though impenitent. <hi>I would ſcatter them into corners,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were it not, that I feared the wrath of the Enemy, and they ſhould ſay, Our hand is high; the Lord hath not done all this. Joſhuah</hi> and others knew it was a ſtrong Plea, <hi>What wilt thou do for thy great Name?</hi> Again, when his People have been ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate under Judgments, that if he preceded in his Wrath, they muſt be utterly deſtroyed; rather than do ſo, he hath eaſed his hand. If the ſins of his Enemies be full, he conniveth at his Church, whiles he avengeth himſelf on his Adverſaries; eſpecially if his Servants are to be Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his Wrath. Sometimes God hath had reſpect to ſome Anceſtor, or ſome particular action of a People, that hath been pleaſing to him; and on that account, hath been favourable, though they have been otherwiſe obnoxious to judgments.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Its not very eaſie at all times, to judge of National Judgments or Mercies. God may afflict in order to Mercy; he may take away leſſer Mercies, to make way for greater Bleſſings: He oft layes a foundation of laſting good, by delays and aſtoniſhing ſtruggles. On the other hand, he may forbear Judgments, and beſtow good things; whereby a Nation is ripened for ſorer Plagues. He may deſtroy the Gentry to ſave the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or level his ſtroak againſt evil Magiſtrates or Miniſters and ſo ſhake the State, to make the Body of a People, or his own people (at leaſt) proſperous. Many ſuch wayes are with him. Each of theſe affect a community, and yet the aſpect of them are ſo intricate and clouded, that deep thoughts are needful to determine, when we ſee the Mercy we expect, or the Judgment which we fear.</p>
            <p>You may perceive that the Caſe before me, though it ſeemeth ſo popular is not ſo eaſily decided. But the greateſt Difficulty is to adjuſt the Nature of Repentance, as accommodated to our expectation of National Mercies: Which will fall under the next Head.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, The Caſe reſolved; and ſomewhat concerning the Rule by which it is reſolved.</p>
            <p>The Rule by which we muſt determine this is hinted in the Caſe it ſelf,<note place="margin">The Rule to decide the Caſe by.</note> under thoſe Words; what Repentance <hi>doth God require?</hi> Some Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Divine Will muſt guide us, we muſt not judge by Second Cauſes, or by vain Fancy, as we are too apt to do. Neither too rigid nor yet too compaſſionate Inclinations muſt decide the Matter, or lead our Expectations. The Directions of the Soveraign Ruler of Kingdoms muſt alone take place; what Notices he hath vouchſafed, muſt be regarded with Reverence; natural Principles, due Inferences from his Eſſential Perfections; the Nature, Order, Ends, and Methods of his Government well conſidered; and an Obſervation of his Dealings with our ſelves in paſt times, and alſo with other Countreys, do all contribute ſome light in the Matter before us.</p>
            <p>But our chiefeſt regard muſt be to the Scriptures: eſpecially to ſuch parts of them, as urge Repentance on a people with Promiſes of good, in caſe of compliance; and Threatnings of Ruin upon their Obſtinacy. Alſo ſuch parts ſhould be obſerved as contain inſtances of National Repentance, which have been ſucceeded or accompanied with National Mercies. By this rule we muſt determine what that Repentance for National Sins is, whereupon we may expect National Mercies. Here we muſt conſider Repentance modified as a means to this proper end, <hi>viz.</hi> National Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: And its to be conſidered as to that loweſt degree, which will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our expectations of thoſe Mercies.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed this. I think it may thus be determined.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Repentance ſhort of that, which is injoyned in order to Eternal Salvation, will ſuffice to warrant our expectations of National Mercies. Eternal Iſſues are not determined by the ſame Rules, as Temporal Bleſſings. Unregenerate perſons may repent, ſo as to divert preſent Judgments, and ſecure Mercies. This is evident in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Nineveh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 21.29. Jonah 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If it were not ſo, we could not expect National Mercies before the generality of a Land became true Converts, yea active Converts: For Regenerate Perſons that ſhall poſſeſs Heaven, may come ſhort in that Repentance, which ſecures Bleſſings to a Nation.</p>
            <p>Saving Repentance is the Grace, we calls ſinners to by our Miniſtry; the more of this prevaileth in a Land, the more ſure are the Mercies of that people. Without it, a Nation will ſoon run into new forfeitures; and bring plagues on it ſelf at laſt; as <hi>Niniveh</hi> did.<note place="margin">Nah. ch. 2. &amp; 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This ſaving Repentance is a change of Heart, as well as Practice; it ſtrikes at the root, and excludeth the Dominion of all Sin; as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Provocations. It hath a mixture of Divine Love reigning in the Heart, as well as Fear: Its excited by a ſence of pardoning Mercy through the Blood of Chriſt, as well as Gods Wrathful diſpleaſure: its an effect of the Spirit in-dwelling, and not onely of its common Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: its the fruit of the Divine Life, and not meerly of Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples excited by Forreign impreſſions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40119:217"/>
            <p>In theſe and the like, ſaving Repentance exceeds that Repentance of a Land, which yet may afford expectations of National Mercies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Repentance which yields us ground to expect National Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, I ſhall deſcribe in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hath ſeveral things wherein it partakes of the nature and ſincerity of a true Repentance. 2. It muſt be for National Sins. 3. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance muſt uſually be National. 4. It muſt be ſuited to the different condition and circumſtances of ſuch as make up a Nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt have ſo much of the nature and ſincerity of a true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as is included in theſe following heads.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Clear Convictions of the guilt and offences of a Nation.</p>
            <p>We muſt believe thoſe things to be ſins, which God chargeth us with, and truly own, that we are chargeable with the faults for which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth us.<note place="margin">Jer. 3.13.</note> This God enjoyneth; <hi>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God.</hi> They cannot be ſaid to Repent, who plead guiltleſs. This Plea God reproveth <hi>Iſrael</hi> for; <hi>yet thou ſayeſt becauſe I am innocent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.35.</note> &amp;c. Whiles Men plead for ſin as no ſin, or acquit themſelves when they are Criminals; ſins bind on them the wrath of God, and ſtand in the way of a peoples good. But there's hope of a Land,<note place="margin">Jer. 14.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0.</note> when it poureth out its Confeſſions with them; <hi>We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge O Lord our wickedneſs, and the iniquity of our Fathers, for we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Shame, fear, and deep humblings of Soul under the ſence of the wrath of God, as provoked by our ſins. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbled himſelf: <hi>Turn to me with faſting and with mourning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel 2.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>rent your hearts and not your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for he is gracious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and repenteth him of the evil; who knows if he will return,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.6.</note> 
               <hi>and leave a Bleſſing behind him?</hi> God will embitter ſin to us, or avenge it. Provocations ſhall prevent Mercy, when they are eaſie and pleaſing; but this remorſe muſt reach to the Heart, though it do not ſavingly change it. The Heart muſt tremble at the threatned Wrath: God will have his anger awful to Men, and their abominations ſhall cauſe a bluſh, at leaſt in a ſence of what miſeries they expoſe to.</p>
            <p>Therefore while people make a mock of ſin, as harmleſs; while they ſport with the wrath kindled thereby, as a ſcare-crow; God will go on to ſtrip a Kingdom of its Bleſſings, and load it with Judgments: <hi>They were not at all aſhamed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 6.15.</note> 
               <hi>neither could they bluſh; therefore at the time that I viſit them, they ſhall be caſt down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Humiliation, Fear and Shame, muſt be from an affected Soul, not bare Bodily appearances in a day of Humiliation, or hanging down the Head like a bulruſh for a day;<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.5.</note> theſe the Lord deſpiſeth, for ſuch things he will not turn away his anger.</p>

            <p n="3">(3.) Such a complyance with Gods warnings and rebukes, as to put Men on ſeeking Gods ſavour, and reſolving to forſake the National pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <pb n="428" facs="tcp:40119:217"/>
            <p>There muſt be ſupplications, as well as weeping:<note place="margin">Jer. 3.21.</note> 
               <hi>A voice was heard on the high places weeping and ſupplications of the Children of Iſrael, for they have perverted their way.</hi> This is Gods advice to a Land, and its the conſtant way of a Repenting people:<note place="margin">Jon. 3.8.</note> Thus <hi>Niniveh cryed mightily to God:</hi> Herein the dominion of God is owned, and ſo far Men acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a dependance upon him: But this muſt not be only with the Mouth, no, it muſt be with the Heart as to this act, and occaſion.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7.14.

               <note place="margin">Dan. 9.13. Ez. 18.29, 30.</note> and as ſad, whilſt they arraign his ways as unequal.</p>
            <p>But good reſolves muſt attend Prayer; a full purpoſe under preſent Convictions, though it may not alwayes prove effectual, through want of a Principle in Sinners, and remains of Corruption in Saints. We are led to this by that place; <hi>Take away all iniquity, Aſhur ſhall not ſave us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>what have I to do any more with idols?</hi>

            <p>Now what hopes can there be of a Land, if it neglect the Lord, as if he had nothing to do with them; yea, continues reſolute in its ſins: Thus did they who ſaid, <hi>after our Idols will we go,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 44.17.</note> 
               <hi>we will worſhip the Queen of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Alas! Such a people may lye down in fear, and look at the Mercies they want, as impoſſible; yea, conſider the Bleſſings they yet enjoy, as ſoon to be removed.</p>
            <p>I added, that Prayer and Reſolves ſhould be in complyance with Gods warnings: God will have a regard to his Threatnings, and ſome tribute of Obedience rendered to him, by them whom he ſpares.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> yielded to <hi>Elijahs</hi> Meſſage, and <hi>Niniveh</hi> regarded the Threatnings of the Lord by <hi>Jonah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore its an awful ſign, when Nations <hi>refuſe to hearken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 7.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>draw away the ſhoulder, and make their heart as an adamant, leaſt they ſhould hear the law, and the words of God by the Prophets.</hi> When this is the frame and carriage of a people towards God, what effects follow, the following words acquaint you: <hi>Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the warnings are ſent by the Word in the mouth of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or by his Wonders, or by leſſer Afflictions; the diſregard of them makes the bands of a people ſtrong; whereas attentiveneſs and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therewith affords encouragement.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) There muſt be a Reformation.</p>
            <p>All the former without this, are too inſufficient to be a prognoſtick of good; the other things tend to this, and muſt terminate therein, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance wants its aptitude to the deſigned end: <hi>I have ſent my Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 35.15.</note> 
               <hi>ſaying, return ye now every man from the evil of his way, and amend your doings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye ſhall dwell in the Land;</hi> a gracious offer, but behold the obſtacle to their benefit thereby; <hi>you have not inclined your ear, nor
<pb facs="tcp:40119:218"/> hearkened unto me:</hi> In the ſame manner God leaves it on this iſſue; <hi>Learn to do well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 1.17, 18, 19.</note> &amp;c. <hi>If you be willing and obedient, yon ſhall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuſe and rebel, you ſhall be devoured with the ſword, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's no Repentance while groſs evils are continued in, if our ſins be ſins of Commiſſion:<note place="margin">Zech. 14.19.</note> It's no Repentance while an expreſs Duty be not complyed with, when the offence is a ſin of Omiſſion: <hi>This ſhall be the puniſhment of all Egypt, and of all Nations that come not up to keep the feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi> Let there be never ſo much mourning, though it riſe to <hi>the covering the Altar with tears,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 58.6.7, 8.</note> it yields but vain hopes, when Men continue unreformed.</p>
            <p>But amendment carryeth with it a happy preſage; it reſtraineth the bitter effects of paſt provocations, and God in Mercy encourageth it in a people, though on the brink of ruine. We ſee an inſtance in <hi>Judg.</hi> 10. the people having confeſſed their ſin, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. accepted of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and called upon God; <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>They put away their ſtrange gods, and ſerved the Lord; then the Soul of God was grieved for their miſery,</hi> and he delivered them, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. A parallel you have in <hi>Niniveh,</hi> the charge given by the King,<note place="margin">Jon. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet further. The Repentance in theſe acts muſt be for Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Sins: If it be for other Sins, and not for the Sins of the Land, it will not warrant our expectations of National Mercies. God will have Men direct their Repentance to that, which his Wrath is kindled for, and which his Teſtimony is againſt. It's not enough that you bewail your own perſonal private ſins, but theſe publick faults. People are loatheſt to own, bewail, and leave theſe National Offences. Cuſtom fixeth them, they are commonly, reputable, and by the generality of Tranſgreſſours thought innocent; they are ſupported by lntereſt and Power; there's danger by Repenting thereof: If you reform as to theſe, there's oft a loſs of Places; Men are ſubject to ſhame by leaving faults in faſhion, or the reproach of having long offended in thoſe things; and how backward are our proud Hearts to acknowledge we have been in an error.</p>
            <p>But let it be never ſo hard, the Arrow of God is levelled againſt theſe very ſins, and even theſe ſhall be bewailed and forſaken, or he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to embitter them.</p>
            <p>People may think to commute with God, and amend in other matters; but this is a vain attempt,<note place="margin">Mic. 6.15, 16.</note> to their own deluſion and ruine: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſow, but ſhalt not reap; for the ſtatutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the houſe of Ahab; and ye walk in their counſels, that I ſhould make thee a deſolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hiſſing: Therefore you ſhall bear the reproach of my people.</hi> This leads me to anſwer one Objection.</p>
            <pb n="433" facs="tcp:40119:218"/>
            <p>Object. <hi>How may we know which be the National Sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the ſame particular Sins be univerſal. Conſider the carriage of a people in general, and compare it with the Word: National Sins are too groſs not to be ſeen, when the rule of a Peoples walking is ſet before us. But if you would know, which are more eminently the National Sins; obſerve what Sins have the greateſt influence in Corrupting the Land; which cleaveth faſteſt to a people, and moſt (eſpecially leading perſons) are guilty of; which have been longeſt continued in, and in their Nature and Conſequences are moſt grievous; which ſeem the Judgments of God moſt directed againſt; what ſins do the beſt Miniſters and People witneſs moſt againſt. By theſe Rules you may diſcern, what are thoſe National Sins, which the Nation agree in the commiſſion of, or conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at. But if the National Sins be by accumulation of ſeveral ſorts of ſins, according to the different ſtate of people, who conſtitute that Community: You then muſt diſtinguiſh a Nation into its conſtituent, or remarkably differing parties; as Magiſtrates and Subjects, Miniſters and People, Rich and Poor, Infidels and Believers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Compare the frame and carriage of each of theſe, with that which God hath made their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Duty; and adding the former helps, thoſe National Sins will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, which are made up by complication, though the ſame individual Crimes are not entertained by the ſeveral parties in a Nation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Repentance muſt uſually be National: I do not mean that every individual muſt repent, but the generality; or at leaſt ſome very conſiderable number, and thoſe of ſuch Men, that moſt repreſent, and influence the Body.</p>
            <p>A ſmall number of private Penitents may ſave themſelves, but ſeldom ſecure a Nation. I confeſs here I muſt be wary, conſidering how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly God is pleaſed to admit ſometimes a few to perſonate a Body, and give in Bleſſings for many on their mediation. <hi>Phineas</hi> his Zeal turns away Wrath from all his people.<note place="margin">Num. 25.11. Ezek. 22.30.</note> God ſeems to conclude the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of <hi>Iſraels</hi> woe, from the want of <hi>one man</hi> to divert it: <hi>I ſought for a man among them that ſhould make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gap before me, for the Land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it, but I found none.</hi> This the deſolate Church complains of;<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.7.</note> 
               <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to take hold of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though Sovereignty admits a very few Penitents to profit many Tranſgreſſors; yet we are not uſually to expect this, what ever in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity we may hope, for want of better grounds; uſually a few are called <hi>none</hi> as to this effect: <hi>No man repented him of his wickedneſs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 8.6. Iſa. 66.4. and 59.16.</note> 
               <hi>I called and none did anſwer; he wondered there was no interceſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were the Prophets themſelves, and ſome others that Repented, yet ſo few were as good as none to ſecure the good, which multitudes concurred to remove. His Call is to the generality to return, and on that he promiſeth favour. <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord all ye of Judah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord: Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cauſe you to dwell in this place:</hi> And the failure by the refuſal he affixeth to the body of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. Thou ſhalt ſay, <hi>This is a Nation, that obeyeth
<pb facs="tcp:40119:219"/> not the voice of the Lord, nor receiveth correction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We can hardly look for good to a Land, unleſs the repenting perſons be numerous enough to vindicate the Glory of God, and influence the Land to Reformation:<note place="margin">Joel 1.14, 15. Jon. 3.5, 6.</note> The aſſembly of Penitents muſt be ſolemn. How general was the Repentance of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> from the greateſt to the leaſt; from the King and Nobles to the moſt abject.</p>
            <p>Some farther light may ariſe from the next head.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Repentance ſhould be ſuited to the different Condition and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe that make up a Nation. Each muſt repent of the ſins common to all, yea, the groſs treſpaſſes of each ſort muſt be bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every ſort.</p>
            <p>But yet there is a Repentance peculiar to each, which ought eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear, or at leaſt really to be; and this exerted according to their reſpective abilities. Magiſtrates ought to mourn for the ſins of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alſo to repent of their own ill Examples, bad Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they muſt expreſs their Repentance by exerting that Power which they have above others: They ſhould enact good Laws, reſtrain and puniſh Sin, command days of Humiliation, appoint good Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ezra</hi> did:<note place="margin">Ezra 10.8, 9. Neh. 13.</note> The ſame did <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Magiſtrates do not repent if they do not ſo, and a Land may periſh for their neglect.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Land divideable into Unbelievers and Believers: Theſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers muſt repent of their own ſins, as well as the ſins of Unbelievers: They muſt be humbled for their own decays; Contentions, Worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Barrenneſs, Vanity, Pride, though leſs groſs then others; as well as for the Idolatry and Profaneneſs of the Irreligious. The Reaſon is, that theſe ſins of theirs contribute to the bringing down Judgments, and obſtructing of Mercies; as well as the groſſer ſins of Unbelievers; nay, in ſome ſenſe more; becauſe they ought to be Witneſſes for God in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Land. Their Examples encourage the groſſer Villanies of others; they have more Light and Strength to keep themſelves pure; yea, if the number of good Men be conſiderable in a Land, the lot of a Nation is moſtly determined by them, and Gods regards is much more to them than others.</p>
            <p>If you take the Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches to be ſo particular, as moſt do; you may ſee how God reproves and threatens them, though ſmall portions of thoſe States, of which they were Members in Civil Reſpects.</p>
            <p>I think I may ſay that the Repentance of Believers for their ſins, muſt exceed the Repentance of Unbelievers in ſome proportion to that Life, Grace and Aids which they have above thoſe Unbelievers; their Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation muſt be deeper, and more ingenuous; their reſolves ſtronger; their return more univerſal; their Prayers more fervent; their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation more extenſive, ſpiritual and vigorous than other men: In this its true as a man is ſo to his ſtrength. If their Repentance be no greater than others, they may expoſe a Nation, and prove its ruine</p>
            <p>I might proceed to Gentry and Commonalty, to Miniſters and People, but time prevents me, and the ſame Rules may guide you in theſe as in
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:40119:219"/> the inſtances before deſcribed: I ſhall only add, that ſuppoſing a part of the Land, Perſecutors, and the other Perſecuted for Truths ſake; theſe latter muſt be humbled for the ſins of Perſecutors, and repent of their own ſins; and that according to the advantage which their Afflictions give for their Humiliation and Amendment.</p>
            <p>While men throw repenting work off of themſelves to others, as if they could acquit themſelves of Gods Challenge; are there not alſo ſins among you, are you no way guilty? The Land is like to ſuffer, and the common condition to be deplorable.</p>
            <p>It's true, if the deſign of God be to ſingle out any one ſort of a Nation to ſuffer by themſelves; the impenitents of that ſort may not dammage the body of the Nation, further than their ſtruggles with, or their loſs of that part may affect the reſidue.</p>
            <p>As if God reſolve to puniſh Profeſſors of Religion only; their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence may affect the whole no further than the diſtreſs of ſuch Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors amounts to, except as it is an awful omen; becauſe Judgment ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom begins at Gods Houſe, but it reacheth in woful iſſues to others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Or, if God hath a Controverſie with the Gentry of a Land, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency may not fatally reach the ordinary people, if penitent. For if God reſolves to puniſh ravenous domineering Paſtors, or Perſecutors; their neglect of Repentance ſhall not hurt the whole that repents; nay, it will be their advantage to have them blaſted if they remain impenitent, as the Kingdoms plagues: It's much more ſo as to particular Families; whether the higheſt or leſs influencing the corruption of a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>But where God deſigns not a diſtinct reſpect in his Judgments, the ſtubbornneſs of any one ſort doth threaten the Nation; their not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a way proper to them, may plunge the whole into a loſs of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, according to my ſmall light, reſolved the Caſe.</p>
            <p>The deciſion of the Caſe proved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The deſcribed Repentance doth ordinarily afford a people National Mercies, notwithſtanding National Sins In the reſolution of the Caſe there occurred ſome Reaſons, and many Scriptures, to evidence this; ſo that I ſhall need to ſay little more for proof: There ſeems to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Rule in this matter;<note place="margin">Jer. 18.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or concerning a Kingdom, to pluck it up, and to pull down, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: If that Nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Repentance which God hath accepted, ſo as to prolong the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Nations, was of this ſort; as you ſee in <hi>Niniveh</hi> and other places.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 12.7.</note> Should we examine the Repentance of any Land, it hath rarely arrived to a greater height: A defect of the Repentance injoined in the Covenant of Grace, is obvious in that Repentance which hath yet been effectual as to National Mercies. This Repentance anſwers the great methods and ends of Gods general Government, as to the Temporal Weale of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and provides a Foundation to proceed upon in thoſe methods,
<pb facs="tcp:40119:220"/> whereby his Spiritual Kingdom is advanced, and the Eternal Welfare of Souls is promoted; we may expect God will continue National Mercies to a People who come up to that Repentance which hath preſerved other Nations.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 7.14. And 30.8, 9. Jer. 26.3, 13.</note> We have great Encouragement to our Hopes from many Texts.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Were it otherwiſe, Gods Name would not be Sanctified, no order in this lower World would be kept. But further,</p>
            <p>Impenitence is not onely a Moral Obſtacle to good, as it provokes God to with-hold it; but its a Natural Obſtacle, the wickedneſs of men is effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of Wo to a People, and is in many ſenſes deſtructive of Mercies, and inconſiſtent therewith. Many Enormities of a Nation are its Plagues; as bad Laws, wickedneſs in Magiſtrates, a corrupt Miniſtry, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Its Iniquity is even materially its Ruin.</p>

               <p>Many Inferences are obvious: As, How dreadful an Evil is Sin. How dangerous to a Land are multitudes of Offenders. A Nation is fooliſh that diſcountenances Piety, and deſtroyeth the godly Party, whereby it ſtrikes at its own Refuge. How good and long-ſuffering is God, that calls the vileſt Nations to return, waits long for their Anſwer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:40119:220"/> not till their Repentance be even hopeleſs. What Enemies to themſelves, Neighbours, and Poſterity (bound up in their doom) are an impenitent people? What ſottiſh and Atheiſtical Men are they, that guide their hopes, and fears of a Nations Welfare, by Fancies or ſecond Cauſes, but without regard to Gods Favour or Anger, or the influence that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Impenitence have upon the wayes of God towards a People. What a diſmal Proſpect is a Wicked Nation, ſporting with their Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Warnings?</p>
               <p>How uncertain a Tenure do moſt Nations hold their Mercies by?</p>
               <p>But I have not time to inſiſt on theſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly apply the Reſolution of the Caſe to our own Nation. We are a Nation; we have National Sins; Repentance of theſe Sins is a preſage of our future State, as well as others: I know no exemption, or peculiar allowance, we can expect at the hands of the righteous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World. Oh that our Hearts were under the Power of this awful Truth, that <hi>our iniquity may not be our ruin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In order to this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall inſiſt on ſome things in order to our Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Enquire, Whether we may groundedly expect National Mercies from our preſent Frame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conclude with an Uſe of Lamentation of our National Impenitency and Dangers.</p>
               <p>In order to our Repentance. I ſhall</p>
               <p n="1">1. Repreſent to you the National Sins we ought to Repent of. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you'l know what we ſhould be humbled for, reſolve againſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. What a Terror ought it be but to mention our Provocations? Oh that a Land of Light ſhould be chargeable with ſuch Enormities, and yet be ſecure, and hate to be reformed!</p>
               <p>Where ſhall I begin the Charge? We and our Fathers for ſome Ages, have been guilty of the ſame ſins, yet unrepented of. Againſt whom ſhall I level the Inditement? Alaſs! we <hi>have all ſinned and done wickedly as we could.</hi> Magiſtrates and Subjects, Miniſters and People, the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Believers. To what ſorts of Sins ſhall I confine my ſelf to? Wo is us, what Sins did God ever deſtroy a Land for, that are not Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal with us.</p>
               <p>But that the ſound may not appear uncertain, I account my ſelf bound in Conſcience, to be more particular. My ſubject forceth me, not any uncharitable deſign. Oh that my own heart were more filled with Zeal for God, and deepeſt ſorrows for the Nations Sin, whiles I am recording what may offend the guilty, though the Charge be too plain to admit a Denial? Let us Enquire:</p>
               <p>Is <hi>England</hi> altogether innocent as to its Laws? Do not we ſee that ſome of the terms of Conformity are far other than our bleſſed Lord hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted? Are they not remote from a tendency to advance real Piety, and excluſive of ſome things that would much conduce thereto?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:221"/>
               <p>Is not a Dioceſan Biſhop ſet up? whoſe ſole Juriſdiction barrs all the other Miniſters from the Exerciſe of a great part of their Office, while the Biſhop is utterly unable to perform it, through the largeneſs of his Dioceſs?</p>
               <p>Is there not more than an Umbrage of Lying and Perjury impoſed on all Miniſters? when they muſt Aſſent, Subſcribe and Swear to what is more than ſuſpicious, yea utterly falſe.</p>
               <p>Are not a heap of Ceremonies and corrupt Uſages re-aſſumed, (though once caſt out) to the facilitating of the return of Popery, dividing of Proteſtants, and the ſcandal of the weak; who are too apt to place Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yea all their Religion, in thoſe Vanities.</p>
               <p>How many ſevere Laws were made againſt Diſſenters, and ſeverely executed to the ruin of Thouſands?</p>
               <p>Was it no provocation to ſilence Two Thouſand Faithful Miniſters when their Labours were ſo neceſſary, and their places were to be filled up with many young Men, who have proved fatal to ſerious Religion? The Sacrament is made a Politick Engine, to further the Damnation of unworthy Receivers; that all ſuch may be kept out, whom they ſuſpect any way hazardous to exceſſive Pomp, and Eccleſiaſtick Pageantry.</p>
               <p>Can the Land be Innocent, where Atheiſm is ſo profeſſed, the moſt Blaſphemous Oathes are faſhionable, Perjury, Uncleanneſs, Drunkenneſs, Malignity againſt all credible Holineſs; ſo common and conſiſtent with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. VVas it not among us, that the Covenant was burnt by the hands of a Common Hangman, and horrid Murthers committed as legal Executions?</p>
               <p>Is not that Chriſtian Nation guilty, where prophanation of Sabbaths is ſo notorious, yea pleaded for as warrantable? Moſt Families have nothing of Gods VVorſhip, the plaineſt Eſſentials of Religion by few underſtood; the Operations of the Spirit turned into Ridicule, and Religion placed in things that bear not a faint reſemblance of the very form of it; while So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety its ſelf is meer matter of Scoff; and the Fountains of Learning ſend forth many more fitted to Infect than Reform the Age?</p>
               <p>Is it to be concealed, that Men enter on the Miniſtry, as Apprentices on a Trade, and uſe it as a meer means for a Livelihood? How many are Paſtors without the peoples Conſent? And too many preach, while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Goſpel as a Law of Faith, and Rule of the Recovery of Apoſtate Sinners: The Labors of ſuch have no tendency to Convert or Edifie their Hearers; yea alaſs Converſion is judged a Fooliſh thing to urge. All the moſt Debauched and Prophane are Regenerate, if they were Baptized, and come to Church. Many Souls eternally periſh by the influence of this one principle, and the Miniſtry is diverted from its greateſt end.</p>
               <p>Have we not ſeen the Miniſtry too much laid out, to ſerve the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in deſigns of enſlaving the Nations, and ruining the Life of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion? Though amazing was the Providence which almoſt too late opened ſome Mens Eyes by a cloſe attempt againſt their own places, and ſo ſwayed their Minds, that they contributed to ſave the Land
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:40119:221"/> from that Ruin, which a few more Sermons of Non reſiſtance (if believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Nation) had rendred unavoidable. The good Lord continue that impulſe, leaſt our Miſeries become greater by the beginnings of our Deliverance.</p>
               <p>I deſign not this Account of all our publick Miniſters, bleſſed be God there are many to whom the Intereſts of Chriſt were more valuable, than to allow their Labors to ſerve any baſe Deſign. But this of late was found the way of Church Preferments, wherewith too many complied; and made the Pulpit a Stage for a poor Oration, rather than a place to teſtifie for God, or bring Souls nigher to him.</p>
               <p>Are Believers and ſerious Chriſtians (whom I confine not to any Sect or Party) free from contributing, to fill up the Meaſure of our Iniquity? Oh that they were! then ſhould my Soul rejoyce in Hope; but its other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: Alaſs how much have they made the vileſt Abominations their own, by not Mourning for them, and by their Carnal Liberty contributing to them: <hi>Our Gold is become droſs.</hi> How unedifying are their Diſcourſes?<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.22.</note> How unexemplary is their Walking? <hi>Each one ſeeks himſelf, and none the things of Chriſt:</hi> Circumſpectneſs is laid by as unfaſhionable, The <hi>Virgins all ſlumber and ſleep.</hi> How few dare plead the Cauſe of God,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.5.</note> or do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Image! What heartleſs Duties, froward Paſſions, notorious Pride, and neglect of Education of Children? Faſt-days are kept without Humiliation; Sacraments and Sermons are become Lifeleſs; God is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly withdrawn, and none bemoan it; Religion is dying, and none uphold it.</p>
               <p>What a Chilneſs on the love of Saints to each others? What ſordid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Diſtances? A new Standard of Godlineſs is erected, <hi>viz.</hi> a Zeal for Parties, and ſelfiſh Intereſts, under pretence of Chriſts Intereſts: Whiles what is eſſentially and undoubtedly his, recommends men little. How little do good men reliſh that Life, Light, and Love, which is purely Divine?</p>
               <p>Can I excuſe Diſſenters, as ſuch? No: To ſay nothing of ſome of them immerſed in deſtructive Errors; alaſs the more Orthodox have a ſhare in polluting and expoſing the Nation. A vain Itch hath ſeized much of our Miniſtry; we ſtudy to pleaſe, rather than profit: We envy one another, run into Extreams, becauſe others come not up to Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. We overlook the Mercy of our Eaſe and Liberty, becauſe we abound not as others do.</p>
               <p>Tremble! Oh my Soul! to think, how many even of them perſecute, by Railing, lying Reports, Non-communion, and cenſuring the ſtate of Souls for Non-compliance with doubtful Notions.</p>
               <p>Too many ſet up uninſtituted Terms of Communion, deſtroy the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Office, promote little deſigns with baſe Tricks, and groſſeſt Lying, under the covert of Equivocation and Surmizes?</p>
               <p>Were it not that ſome breath another Spirit, and more ſuitable to the Divine Nature, and the Goſpel of Chriſt; I ſhould ſit down with Horror, and give up the Land for loſt. The ſhadow hath ſenſibly eaten up the Subſtance; we have fancied, talked and diſputed a Goſpel Frame, and
<pb facs="tcp:40119:222"/> practical Holineſs almoſt out of the Land. A dead form is that which moſt are content with, and carnally plead for, whiles they profeſs more purity and power than others.</p>
               <p>Are theſe Evils in the Land or no? Are they Sins? Are they not Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral? Ariſe O God! and Convince us; embitter them to us. Oh was there ever more need to crave the powrings out of thy Spirit, now its receſſes are ſo manifeſt. How diſcernable will be its powrings out, if thou bleſs us therewith?</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do in the Name of God Call you to this true Repentance for theſe National Sins.</p>
               <p>VVe have nothing elſe left to relieve us, our begun Deliverance will be Abortive, yea more deſtructive without Repentance. VVhat Nation ever needed Repentance more, whom hath God oftener Called, and more expreſly warned?</p>
               <p>He hath long waited to be Gracious, and muſt he deſtroy us at laſt, when weary of Repenting? The Ruins of all our Neighbours cry to us, Repent; or you will be more Miſerable than we are: God ſeems to be on his way to you with the Dregs of the Cup. Our Sins are of the groſſeſt Nature, the longeſt Continuance, and ſoreſt Aggravations.</p>

When will Miniſters engage in the Reformation of the Land, by faithful Warnings, ſharp Reproofs, good Examples, plain and importunate Pleadings?

               <p n="2">2. Let us enquire, whether we may expect National Mercies from our preſent frame and ſtate. I believe God will not forſake us, but in time he will do us good. But the Enquiry is meant thus; Whether Mercy will be immediately enjoyed; is the wrath of God turned away; and will his progreſs in a way of Judgments be ſtopped?</p>
               <p>Can we reaſonably conclude, though the Sword hath been furbiſhed, it ſhall not deſtroy: Our Warfare is accompliſhed; the Clouds are paſt; the bitterneſs of Death is over. Dare I ſay, rejoyce O Land in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a reconciled God? For good, only good, ſhall preſently be unto thee.</p>
               <p>I ſhall by way of Objections give you what is matter of Hopes; and in the Anſwer to thoſe Objections give you the ground of my Fears, and in the end declare my Thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Are there not ſome Teſtimonies of National Repentance, from whence we may hope Mercy is towards us? As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Penal Laws againſt the Worſhip of God are as good as diſannulled, and Perſecution is at a ſtop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I wiſh the general remains of Malignity, argue not a ſorrow for that Liberty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I find moſt of them that were guilty of Perſecution, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of it, do juſtifie it as a juſt Proſecution; though it was an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Rights of People, as Men, and as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Are the Sacrament Teſt, and Act of Uniformity removed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We had a publick Faſt-day kept with outward Solemnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I'll judge of no Mans Heart, yet I cannot but obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The moſt polluting Sins of the Land were not ſolemnly owned, much leſs bewailed. Where was a publick acknowledgment of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Silencing Two Thouſand Miniſters, becauſe they durſt not profane their Office, and plainly Lye and Perjure themſelves. I might name ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch other ſins; alas, general Confeſſions avail little.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:40119:223"/>2. What publick Reformation in Life and Manners appears ſince that day? What fewer Oaths? Profaneneſs is no way abated: Men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the Dog to the vomit. Now Faſtings without amendment are but a mockery with God, and profit not a people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Men are ſo far from Repentance, that they cannot endure to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for their ſins. They ſay you irritate, if you mention their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. They like to hear others accuſed, but abhor the leaſt hint againſt their own faults. Tell the impoſer on the Church that uninſtituted terms of Communion are ſinful, and rage is awakened. Perſwade the bitter Spirit to be Peaceable, and his Tongue is ſoon envenomed, and you ſhall be railed on, as the great diſturber.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>But a great part of the Land is innocent of ſome of the moſt notorious Crimes; the ſober Perſons are many, who ſhare not in the Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Land: The perſecuted and ejected cannot be guilty of the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were under; and many of the Church of</hi> England <hi>never agreed thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How little do ſuch truly mourn for thoſe ſins of other Men? How much more common is it to hear the better ſort ſcoff and laugh at Profaneneſs, than bewail it? Perſecutors are more railed at, than mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. By this we become guilty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are not there iniquities with the ſoberer part of the Nation; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitently continued in to this day? Do we ſee backſlidings healed; how much more Mortified, Heavenly, Circumſpect, Charitable or Fruitful, are the hopefulleſt perſons in the Land, by all our Calls? Yea, our Complaints though ſo general, little tend to alter us.<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Righteouſneſs is as filthy rags, we fade as a leaf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But if we conſider the Sovereign dealings of God with us, may not we expect Mercy, though we ſee not Repentance? As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath lately wrought a great Deliverance, when we were on the brink of ruin, and that by a ſeries of Miracles, when we were as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as we are now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Such Deliverances are never compleated, and ſeldom long continue, where Repentance doth not immediately follow. Though God may command Deliverance firſt, yet he annexeth Holineſs to it; and where that fails, the beginnings of ſafety prove a ſnare,<note place="margin">Obad. 17. Ezek. 36.23, 25</note> and do expoſe to greater diſtreſs. <hi>When he ſaved from Babylon, he cleanſeth them from iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Do not we find that Deliverance is at a ſenſible ſtop, for want of our amendment? Inſtruments to ſave us ſeem leſs apt, our Enemies are in better heart, and a much more threatening poſture. The hand of God is at a ſtop: Thoſe hopeful touches on the minds of Men, are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced: They that mean well are leſs ſpirited and entruſted: They who deſign ill, are more vigorous and countenanced. What a Change have a few Months made in our hopes, though they were raiſed by the higheſt diſplayes of Divine Power and Goodneſs? It's almoſt true;<note place="margin">2 Kin. 19.3. Iſa. 26.18, 17. and 33.11.</note> 
                  <hi>You ſhall conceive chaff and bring forth ſtubble, your breath as fire ſhall devour you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:40119:224"/>2. <hi>May not we hope that God will finiſh our Salvation for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and not ſuffer a work, wherein he hath ſo immediately appeared, to be imperfect; notwithſtanding we reform not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God hath his Honour concerned in giving National Mercies to an impenitent People, as well as in not perfecting a begun Deliverance. He is Sanctified in afflicting a ſinful Land;<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.16. Ezek. 28.15. Pſal. 74.10, 18.</note> his Government is expoſed in ſparing an unperſwadable People: Nay, we oftner find him bear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of not Delivering his Afflicted People, than of not puniſhing a Rebellious People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God can ſecure his Honour in both theſe reſpects, with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency. He may ruin Popery in other places, whiles he expoſeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to it here. He may perfect this begun Deliverance in <hi>England</hi> as to Papiſts, that they may not blaſpheme; and yet diſtreſs Proteſtants by each other, and ſo ſtill puniſh the Land for its impenitency.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>God ſeems to ſingle out ſome particular Families for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who have been moſt acceſſary to the ſins of our Land. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſucceſſion, and ſo it's probable, he may not puniſh the Nation for the iniquity of the Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God may puniſh a Land for the ſins of a former King, though the Government be transferred into another Family. God puniſhed <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> with three years Famine in <hi>Davids</hi> Reign,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.1.</note> 
                  <hi>for Saul and his bloody houſe,</hi> becauſe he ſlew the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If others do not take warning by ſuch Judgments, as are levelled againſt particular perſons, and repent; Judgments will extend beyond thoſe perſons or Families. Succeſſors by the ſame neglects and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will expoſe a Land to miſeries; though their title be not derived by deſcent from former offenders. Yea, if a new Government and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple purge not the Land of the Crimes, which had their riſe in a former Court; the vengeance will follow to the extent of the infection, and the guilty at leaſt be in danger of miſery. <hi>David</hi> righted the injured <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> before the Famine ceaſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How little is Profaneneſs or Irreligion reſtrained? How faint and few are the attempts for Reforming the Nation, ſince God hath bleſſed us with a prognoſtick of good, in the Change of our Government? Are Men ſpirited for this, as <hi>Joſiah, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> &amp;c. To be infected by others ſeems eaſier than to reform them.</p>
               <p>Object. 5. <hi>Are we not under ſuch accompliſhment of Propheſies, as may argue a Proteſtant Kingdom begun to be delivered; ſhall have its deliverance perfected, notwithſtanding its ſinful diſtempers. Is not the</hi> Philadelphian <hi>ſtate beginning; the Witneſſes riſing; the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Empire falling, and Antichriſts ruin juſt reviving and perfecting even to the utmoſt of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments determined againſt him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am well perſwaded of all this, and have declared it many years; when the contrary was more probable as to the poſture of affairs here, and in the reſt of <hi>Europe;</hi> yet let me tell you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the accompliſhment of theſe Propheſies, the Spirit will be abundantly poured out, in order to the eminent Holineſs of ſuch places,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:40119:224"/> as ſhare in theſe Bleſſings. All the Promiſes that refer to theſe latter days are full of Peace, Purity of Doctrine, and Worſhip, and true Godlineſs. With the Song for Antichriſts Fall, the Church <hi>is made ready, and clean linnen which is the righteouſneſs of the Saints, is given to her.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 19.2, 7, 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Almoſt at the Entrance of fulfilling theſe Propheſies, there will be the moſt ſhaking, and aſtoniſhing Diſpenſation towards the Churches, as ever befel them, Then <hi>is the great Earthquake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">and 16.18. and 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the Earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great. This is that hour of Temptation, which ſhall eome upon all the world.</hi> Theſe Epiſtles I take to be Prophetick of the moſt eminent periods of the Church-ſtate, from Chriſts time, to the End of the World; and this Trial is in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> State. Its true indeed, this will benefit the Church at laſt, and be fatal to its Enemies and falſe Members, but it will be terrible to all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such an awful Diſpenſation ſeems neceſſary to purge the Church, and lay a good foundation of its real, and laſting Glory. This will be a means to convince falſe and irreligious Proteſtants,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>that ſaid they were Jews, and were not.</hi> It will pluck up every plant out of the Church, which God hath not planted. Hereby all Conſtitutions repugnant to Chriſts Intereſts, will be overthrown. Without ſuch a Paroxiſme, how ſhould degenerated Chriſtianity recover it ſelf? How ſhall the power of reforming the Church be reſcued out of the hands of ſuch, who hate its Purity, and Spiritual Welfare?</p>
               <p>Its next to impoſſible, by any Calmer means to ſettle Peace in the Church, or awaken <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of that formal Temper, which is the Epidemick Crime of the <hi>Sardinian</hi> interval. You have it expreſſed in thoſe Words, <hi>Thou haſt a name to live, and art dead.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.1.</note> Many are really dead as Unregenerate, others dead in oppoſition to Spiritual Livelineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus I have repreſented to you, what ſeems moſt conſiderable as to the poſture of our Land, with reſpect to National Mercies.</p>
               <p>I ſhall offer my own thoughts upon the whole.</p>
               <p>I think the Repentance of <hi>England</hi> for National Sins is ſhort of that, which may give us grounds to expect National Mercies.</p>
               <p>The methods of God indeed ſeem deſign'd to make us a happy people, but it muſt be in the proper way, and ſeaſon. The great things God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to work, the Liberty he hath ſettled, the diſpoſition in many young ones to return to God, and comply with his Deſigns: his manifeſt expoſing ſuch, who were likely to obſtruct a Reformation, ſupport my Hopes that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are in reſerve for this ſinful Land; but yet its probable, that ſome extraordinary Storm will fall upon the Nation, as a means to bring us to amendment, and a Teſtimony from Heaven againſt our crying Evils, and ſhameful Impenitency. By terrible things, God will prepare us for Bleſſings; and introduce our Happineſs, by that which will try our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Faith. I can hardly account our Foundations ſure, while men juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Sins, and perſiſt in them. Our very Reformation is impoſſible, whiles men of moſt influence have no heart to it, yea hate, and fear it.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40119:225"/>
               <p>Whenever I ſee Magiſtrates engage in reforming us, as their great Duty, and with their whole might:</p>
               <p>VVhen men of power eſteem Repentance, to be the trueſt Intereſt of the Nation.</p>
               <p>VVhen the Miniſtry is awakened to cry aloud, and doth impartially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the Land all its Sins, and Dangers; not miſtaking, or palliat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Offences.</p>
               <p>VVhen the Body of the Land, at leaſt a conſiderable part of it, do crave and approve of Reformation, and concur with the Means, God ſhall prepare for it.</p>
               <p>Then and not till then, ſhall I account our Repentance hopeful, and conſequently expect the Bleſſings to be eſtabliſhed, which God ſeems ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to beſtow.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 24.22.</note>But <hi>who ſhall live when God doth this?</hi> VVhat overturnings will effect it, when ſo many have failed to do us any good? Its ſomething very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing, which can alter Minds ſo averſe; or remove men unchangeably Obſtinate: Yet the Providences of God towards <hi>England</hi> are like to be terrible in proportion to all this.</p>
               <p>I do not herein limit the Holy One, but humbly propoſe my thoughts, as to the uſual aptitude of Means to their End; not wholly neglecting the indications of preſent Providences, as to this matter; much leſs would I overlook Scripture Propheſies.</p>

               <p>The Land is full of Sin, after all the means which were ſent to cleanſe us. The Fire hath devoured, yet our Droſs remains. The plague hath in its Rage ſwept away Thouſands, yet the provocations of <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate not. How oft hath the Lord cried, <hi>Wilt thou not be clean, when ſhall it once be?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 12.27.</note> But we have held faſt our ſeveral Iniquities.</p>
               <p>Its but lately, that Popery and Slavery, were coming on us like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge to the amazement of all, that could with any Zeal conſider it; but the Nation now ſeems ſorry, that it was at all Convinced; and repents, that there was the leaſt motion in it towards amendment.</p>
               <p>Oh the ferment! that haſtily ſucceeded our Fears, leaſt Sobriety or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhould obtain. God hath followed his rebukes with undeſerved, yea unexpected Mercies; but this Sun-ſhine hath made Weeds to grow, inſtead of rendring Judgments effectual, to make us Holy.</p>
               <p>What Methods have been untried, but none ſucceed. Which is the Nation, that ever withſtood ſo many, and various Calls to Repentance? <hi>Niniveh</hi> is <hi>England</hi>'s Reproach; ſhe repented at the firſt warning. <hi>Sodom</hi>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:40119:225"/> would have condemned us, had it been truſted with half our Advantages. Can the Earth ſhew an Inſtance of perverſeneſs, equal to ours? As if the Goſpel had extinguiſhed Natural Conſcience, or a Chriſtian Profeſſion did make us more regardleſs than Pagans. Every thing ſeems to harden us, we grow worſe by thoſe things that recover others.</p>
               <p>Alaſs! We have few that bemoan our want of Mourning; are all our <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s aſleep, that none drop a Tear for <hi>England</hi>'s Security? Do all think it needleſs, or hopeleſs, to turn unto the Lord, that ſo few ſeem to ſet themſelves in earneſt about it. How very few ſymptoms have we, that we are not under a judicial Hardneſs? Many are convinced they ought to Repent, yea many reſolve it, but how Abortive doth all prove? Our Iniquities baffle our Reſolves, and Satan triumphs over the vanity of our Purpoſes. What a hateful proſpect doth our Nation afford to God and Angels? We are a wonder to our ſelves, when a Drowſie Mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us to entertain any ſerious Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Lord what will the End of theſe things be? Wilt thou always bear, and ſeem to obſerve our Provocations, as ſlightily as we do? Alaſs! this would make us more miſerable, than Gods ſoreſt Rebukes: Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more awful than any we have yet felt, are become even neceſſary to our Happineſs; but though they be needful, what heart can endure them? What Terror muſt attend thoſe Diſpenſations, which will ſeparate the Precious from the Vile, pluck up Conſtitutions ſo rooted by Intereſt, Cuſtom, Malignity and Ignorance: Diſable the Irreligious from ſettling Church or State; and imbitter our reigning Sins to careleſs, ſcornful and reſolute Offenders?</p>
               <p>How dreadful is that ſtorm, that will drive all good Men together; when they are canton'd into ſo many Parties, embittered by mutual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, fond of, and valuing themſelves by fond Opinions, and diſtances from others; eſpecially whiles ſelf-conceit and ignorance ſo prevail?</p>
               <p>How hot is that Fire, which will purge out the Droſs among Churches, when its eaten even into our Hearts?
